Prayer of an Inca

To the Thebaida, where, alone, in tears, I kneel, Drunk, like a pagan, of the light that descends from above - Lower, O Sun, the flow of your red blood To anoint my being and bless my prayer.

My only God is you: it is to you that I pray this Gospel: for without you, who kisses me and warms me?
Who puts young wheat on the flower of the old ground?
Under whose gaze does the desert land flourish?

It is you, it is to your gaze: who are the arm that lights up The stars in the sky, in my soul my Dream,
The flowers on the ground and the Moon that shines high.

And this is why, being the Source of all Life,
It is on my knees, praying, that I
set my eyes on thee, O far-off beacon of the Promised Land!
