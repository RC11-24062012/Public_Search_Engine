A word is dead
When it is said,
Some say.
I say it just
Begins to live
That day.
-Emily Dickinson (1872)

Welcome to my web site! Words are indeed living; they speak to us across centuries and continents. With the advent of computer technology in the classroom, new realms open up for communication between people and exploration of the written word. Here you'll find connections to the two courses I teach, Advanced Placement Literature and British Literature, as well as some Internet links students, parents and other educators might find interesting. I have tried to include generally helpful information for my students at Ridge High School and their parents as well as links to myriad locations that may prove interesting to students, parents and colleagues. As with education and life, this site is under constant construction so I apologize for any temporary dead ends. Have fun, learn and don't forget to bring along your imagination!

A big thank-you is in order to my technical advisor, without whose help I couldn't have designed this page and without whose inspiration I wouldn't be a teacher, my daughter Meredith!
