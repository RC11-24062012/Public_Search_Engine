The Philosophy Webring

Welcome to the Philosophy Webring! This webring is for pages containing subject matter related to philosophy. What is philosophy? The word "philosophy" literally means "love of wisdom". Basically, anything involving the pursuit of wisdom is considered philosophy, and therefore any web page involving the pursuit of wisdom is appropriate for this webring. Philosophy generally includes such topics as metaphysics (cosmology and ontology), epistemology, teleology, logic, ethics, and asthetics. It often deals with such issues as the nature of reality, the mind-body problem, causality, determinism vs. free will, as well as the basics, such as "who are we?", "why are we here?", and "what is our purpose?". Any form of thought which attempts to explain or understand this type of issues can be considered philosophy. If you have a web page which deals with philosophy or any philosophical issues, please submit your page to become a part of this ring. Information on joining can be found below.
