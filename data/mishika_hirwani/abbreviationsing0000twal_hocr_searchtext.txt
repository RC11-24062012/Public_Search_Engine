A SENTENCE that occurs in the late Charles Graux' review
of Lehmann's Die tachygraphischen Abkürzungen will explain the purpose of this pamphlet. He says, ‘il est absolu- ment indispensable que beaucoup d'observations exactes soient d'abord publiées avant que, à l'exemple du natural- iste qui dresse comparativement un tableau de la faune ‘ou de la flore des divers régions du globe, les paléographes puissent un jour établir l'état des abréviations usitées dans le monde byzantin de відсів en відсів!" The science of Greek Palaeography, or at least that portion of it which deals with contractions, has reached a point at which what is necessary for its progress is not the production of all- inclusive handbooks with an immediate practical aim, where conclusions are laid down with all possible definiteness and width, but rather a series of observations of the actual usage of manuscripts, noted with all available accuracy by investigators whose occupations have given them familiarity with the ways of scribes and the possibilities of Greek writing. Such observations indeed must be classified and brought into relations with one another, and hypotheses may be suggested to explain the facts observed; but, as with any other yet undeveloped science, the first and main object must be the collection of fresh evidence. How little has been done towards such collection is known to anyone who has tried to find definite information upon the

origin and history of any single Greek abbreviation. Com- paratively little stress is laid. on the subject of compendia in Montfaucon's great book, and Bast's well-known Commentatio Palaeographica, though stimulating in the highest degree, and the work of one Su palaeographical knowledge can seldom have been surpassed, has a directly practical inten- tion, and moreover hardly recognises the principle of chrono- logical development in the history of a compendium. The recognition and application of such principles to compendia forms the cardinal merit of Lehmann's handbook, a work that with all its industry and system is in point of actual palaeographical expertness far behind the Commentatio Palaeographica; both Graux and Vitelli have pointed out, with indisputable truth, the impossibility of deriving general conclusions in palaeography from the compilation of fac- similes. Professor Vitelli however has at length given us the first instalments of a treatise, that, independent of the actual value of its results, is a model in all respects of what such a work should be. The Museo Italiano, part I. pp. 9-15, 32; IL 168-173 contains a great number of his observations upon codices in the Laurentian and ејве- where. I shall be more than gratified if this pamphlet, which owes so much to the Spicilegio Fiorentino, be thought a not unworthy companion to it.
The bulk of the material presented here is taken from manuscripts in the Bodleian and the British Museum ; but a tour in France and Italy in the early part of last year (1888), undertaken under the Craven Trust, has enabled a number of additional examples to be added to those already collected. In arranging the compendia in alpha- betical order I have thought to consult the convenience of those looking for examples of any one in particular; at the end are collected some instances of tachygraphy which are grouped under the several manuscripts. I have endeavoured in discussing the various forms to avoid the faults urged against others ; where hypotheses are ventured, it is as hypotheses that they are given, and with the
А, 3
knowledge that a little increase in our information may overset them ; I shall feel no particular shame if such a fate befalls one or two of my ‘combinations’: caedimus inque vicem, praebemus crura, sagittis is a line that every palaeo- grapher should accept. |
The plates have been produced by a photographie process at the University Press, and will, it is hoped, be thought. more successful than previous reproductions of drawings.
I have finally the pleasant duty of thanking many librarians, at home and abroad, to whose kindness the possi- bility of making this collection has been due: to some of them my thanks have been already elsewhere given : here I gladly record my obligation to the Rev. Gio. Bollig at the Vatican, the Rev. Antonio Ceriani at the Ambrosiana, the Abate Anziani at the Laurenziana, Conte Soranzo at Venice, M. Henri Omont at Paris, Bodley’s Librarian and Mr. Madan in Oxford, and lastly to the Principal Librarian of the British Museum, for constant encouragement and advice.
A. Alpha, it is well known, is properly represented by a horizontal stroke, improperly by a horizontal stroke dotted ; the latter sign properly denotes то, and in this sense - is often found, though probably not so often as the dotted v; this abuse of the two dots, most frequent in combination with r, still occurs freely with other letters ; lastly, there are many mss. which make use of the notation both in the original and in the illegitimate sense. I give examples of these four cases : (1) the simple horizontal stroke appears to be exclusively used in the scholia of the Arethas-mss. ! ; 1 By the ‘Arethas-mss.’ I mean the manuscripts which are known to have
belonged to Arethas, deacon of Patrae, and afterwards archbishop of Caesarea,
and which contain large quantities of scholia, apparently in the same hand :
I here refer to five-—the D'Orville Euclid (888), Clarke Plato (896), Lucian
Harleian 5694 (undated), Aristotle Urbinas 35 (undated), Clement Paris grec
451 (914); cf. generally the Observationes Palaeographicae of E. Maass in the

of so large an extent of scholia it is impossible to speak certainly, but at least the tachygraphic dots, whether as та ог a, are very rare in these mss. : cf. oyAua ебидвела from Lucian. The dots may be more certainly said not to appear in the Gospels Bodl. Auct. E. 5. 11 (s. X-XI), though the total amount of abbreviation here is comparatively small: cf. Basıreıav napa}. (2) mss. in which the dotted stroke occurs and is always ro, are Grotta Ferrata В. а. iii. (s. XII) mavra та ката, бпостбоєсос, матолдтнта ; Epistles, Bodl. Auct. E. 5. 9. (в. X) кота, фпагорєбоута, with Báckavoc, буткавстацеуоу : Philo, Selden supr. 12 (s. X) éyovro, тадта. (3) The most frequent case is that in which a manuscript uses at one and the same time the dotted stroke and the dotted т to ex- press ta: such are the Paris Demosthenes? (2, grec 2934, в. X) cuumepácpora, ката, but прос ra; Clement Mutin. 126 (s. X) évoráceic, та; Nonnus Add. mss. 18231 (a. 972) та éraEev та; Vat. 1982? (s. X) та dora; Iliad Venetus A ёпета (schol.) воџолеоута (text) ; Psalter, Bodl. Auct. T. 4. 19 (s. X) éxovra, rà; Aristides Vat. 1298 (s. X-XI)* ravra таё; Hermogenes Paris grec 1983 (s. XI-XII)? граџџата, та; S. Maximus Angelic. T. 1. 8 (s. XI) návra, óvra; S. Maximus Mutin. 12 (s. XII) vonuara $o&a;ovro, rà mparuara; Palladius Aed. Christ. 70 (a. тод)? meipá;erau werd. Clarke 12 (Greg. Naz. s. X) combines the simple stroke for alpha with the dotted т for ro, cf. ката r&v, mapadadacciov. It is in anyone's power to extend this list. (4) The use of the double dots in combination with other consonants than r is fairly common ; it is most thoroughly carried out perhaps in the school of S. Nilo; cf. ^ao0 from B. a. xix (a. 965, hand 1 A rather late instance of the simple stroke is roAAdkıs from the ms. Turin . I. 22 (а. 1149). Cf. also diAayadov from Galen Н. 45 Arch. S. Petr. (s.

B. 3. 111: the use of the dots for the syllable op (already fully rendered by the compendium) in such words as џартос, етиваррнсес from the London Nonnus, is a characteristic of the school; the ring in the compendium is turned indifferently up or down. Other mss. where the dots are thus freely combined with consonants are Nonnus Paris suppl. grec 469 A (а. 986) та $écua; Vat. 1982 Evrauda, madaicavrec Вавос; Vat. 1298 mapadeıruarıkac ; and similarly the Hermogenes Par. grec 1983.
Al. The ordinary sign for the diphthong a hardly needs fresh exemplification?; it is constant in the Arethas- scholia, and, among other tenth-century mss., in Clarke 12 and Mutin. 126. The tachygraphic form has not met me outside the Grotta Ferrata school (q. v.)?. A curious form occurs repeatedly in Barocc. 26 (Canons, &c., s. XI ineunt.) ; cf. ¿Earopázovrar f. 209 r., поредоута: f. 346 ملا‎ 40 f. 347 r.: it is not unlike the sign which Vitelli (p. 12 n. 8) explains as a prolongation of the tachygraphic symbol; but I think it as likely that it may be merely the sign for e used by itacism ; cf. Əñmore from the same ms.
AIZ. Lehmann’s remarks upon the comparatively late origin of the double apostrophe for atc are just; the Arethas-mss. use no single sign for the syllable, but render it by the sign for a with sigma attached: so брөоїс, raic from the D'Orv. Euclid. At the same time the sign must have been in existence by the beginning of the
1 Lehmann well illustrates the use from Nonnus, Add. ms. 18231.
? The separation of the sign from its preceding consonant, which Prof. Vitelli (p. 172 n. 3) seems to think rare, is common in the Arethas-mss.: cf. yeopérpais, mAevpai D'Orv. Euclid, daivera Plato, сфаїра Lucian; also 46 Mutin. 126 (Clement), kaxodazuóvos Vallicell. F. то. The matter seems to be one of indifference.

tenth century, for the scholia to the Paris Plato, grec 1807 offer, as Bast was aware, both modes of rendering the syllable: cf. edwyiac f. 7 r., тоїс Ё 99 г. The double apostrophe occurs in the ms. of Gregory Nazianzen's. poems, Clarke 12, which I take to be of the earlier half of the tenth century; cf. aisypaic, aóraic: the earliest dated ms. in which the sign occurs appears to be the interesting Nonnus, Paris suppl. grec 469 A of A. D. 986, cf. wuyate т. Vat. 1298 (X-XI) again, uses both modes, e. g. roic, yvyaic 2. The sign is uniformly absent from the Grotta Ferrata mss., which, where they give the syllable abbreviated, use the tachygraphie symbol. The single apostrophe, of which Vitelli gives some examples, p. 12, occurs in Clarke r2, f. 96 v. Bapelar Kal dewaic бВрєсіу, f. 201 v. Talc mapééÉvoic, Laud. gr. 39 (s.

AN. The examples that I give of this commonest of com- pendiums are meant to illustrate the freedom with which it can be written on the line or attached to a preceding letter; &dwkav бтбу from the Paris Plato, gr. 1807, ёду, oúx ávréoyev from Vat. 1982, odcav from Selden supr. 12, поуті órav from Roe 16 (Epistles, s. X exeunt), rav ойк dv, kdv from Bodl. Misc. 251 (Epictetus, s. XII)’. Vitelli has noticed (p. 171) that this sign sometimes stands for the syllable au. I subjoin one or twa instances of its use in this sense and also as representing ar, viz. Aaußavöuevaı, D'Orv. Euclid, дуалацВдує, Harl. Lucian, ómo^augávo Vat.
* Philo, saec. xi Coxe, but the ms. may as probably belong to the century before, it is in bold minuscule above the line. F. 96 r. a late hand has expanded the symbol in question into -aıs.

АПО. A correct account is given in Lehmann of this pre- position, though his examples may be greatly multiplied. The Arethas-mss., as is their general wont with pre- positions!, reject the symbol altogether, and abbreviate by superimposing r; the same is the rule with the Paris Plato. The Grotta Ferrata mss., including the London Nonnus, vary between this mode of abbreviation and a very decided type of the compendium, that may be taken as the purest: form of it existing in minuscule: cf. árro, from Nonnus, ånò тйс, апологновџеуос, from Isidore (В. a. 1), 67٥000۷6, dro балдоснс from Angel В. 3. rr. Precisely the same form is offered by Vat. 1982, 67۵ róv, бполєїуєсвах Forms more or less departing from this
. type are of very common occurrence: I give from the Paris Demosthenes 2934 (2) f. 235 r., дповноєтаї, 229 r. amd тйс, 217 т. дпололас; from the Bologna Euclid, Archi- ginnasio A. т. 18, 19 (s. XI), dnd, àmorouá; from Bodl. Misc. 251 émobeito?, Forms a step further removed are arredeığev, arroduesgar from Clarke 12, апо tov amo tHe from Laur. 28, 3, àmo from Barocc. 235 (Caten. in Psalm. s. X-XI), amorövoı from Laud. gr. 1 (Psalter, s. XI)?; in the last example the scribe was unaware of the proper force of the symbol, cf. the similar case quoted ap. Lehmann, р. 84. For the same sign in the sense of Omo, v. s. v.
AP. Since Prof. Vitelli has thought it worth while to collect evidence for the use of this compendium, some further instances may not be out of place. The form however cannot be called rare: the article in Lehmann is quite inadequate. The Arethas-mss, use the symbol very seldom ; of those in England I have found it only in the Clarke Plato, Ё 370 v. ётубриоо ; of the Paris Clement and Urbinas

35 I would not be so positive! The Grotta Ferrata school on the other hand have the sign passim, with and without the superfluous dots, (v. under A), with the ring above or below, the stroke horizontal or slanting, in the middle or at the end of words: cf. Варвароу, mapeaAncıv from Nonnus, фбрџакоу фӨортну from Isidore, ápoprukóot ppeap from Angel. B. 3. 11, ápeapróv from G. Е. В. a. iii (з. ХП); the simple form occurs also in Vat. 1982, anapriav, обторкос, that with the dots in Mutin. 12 (s. XII) боркдс, кавардеутес. Other examples are буор, ёё dprovc from Mutin. 126 (s. X), будбЕсруос, нтор from Clarke 12, mapeevou from Вод]. Auct. E. s. 11 (в. X), ápogro^oóc kapmóv from Laud. gr. I (s. XI-XII), ó uápkoc from Vallicell. E. до (Caten. s. XD), вуаџартитоос from Epictetus Bodl. Misc. 251 (s. XII), dereap, ónápyew from Neap. П. А а. 22 (s. XI-XIT).
APA, Vitelli’s remark that this compendium, though possibly rare on the whole, is frequent in mss. of a particular class, is illustrated by the examples that I have here to give. In the D'Orville Euchd it 1s naturally frequent, without accent as a rule in the text, whose scribe Stephanus very largely omits both accents and breathings; with accent and breath- ing in the scholia: cf. nos. 1, 2; it is found also in the scholia of the other Arethas-mss., e.g. no. 3 from the Clarke Plato, no. 4 from Urbinas 35: among mathematical mss. it occurs in the mathematical scholia to the Anthology (Paris suppl. grec 384, Ё 639, «е., cf. no. 5), in Euclid Laur. 28, 3 (no. 6), both round and angular forms in Euclid Bologn. Archigin. A. 1. 18 (nos. 7,8). The form is frequent in Bodl. Misc. 251, and in the sense of dpa, cf. no. 9. As a part of mapd, both shapes are found in the Paris Plato, grec 1807, e.g. Ё 7 r., 20 г. (nos. 10, ІІ). Vat. 191 (varia math., в. XV) has the sign occasionally, nos. 12, 13. I have not seen it in mss. of the Grotta Ferrata school?.

AY. Of this diphthong I can only produce instances from a few mss. more or less tachygraphical in character: viz. Vat. 1982 ёутаова (bis) тобта and passim, Grott. Ferr. B. а. iii. (s. XII) табтнс, rotat tH éavróv, and very often. The sign occurs most abundantly in the London Nonnus, but ap- parently only in the strictly tachygraphical portion 1,
AYTOZ. A ligature for this pronoun worth recording occurs in some of the Grotta Ferrata mss. ; it consists of the а and v run together with the case-ending added: cf. 6 aúroic обтну éavróv woaurwc from Gr. Ferr. В. a. 1. and Angel.
В. 3.11. A similar combination of a and v occurs in адтоб from Aed. Christ. 70 (a. 1104), and the ligature is probably common.
FAP. I give a selection of more noticeable forms assumed by rap. Nos. 1 and 2 are from the D'Orville Euclid and Harleian Lucian respectively, and this uncial form is usual in the Arethas-scholia : no. 3 is from the text of the D'Orv. Euclid. Forms with the uncial Gamma are 4 from Genuens. 7? (a. 1057), 5 from Barocc. 196 (a. 1042), 6 from Mutin. 230 (a. 1051), 7 from Aed. Christ. 70 (a. 1104), 8 from Bodl. Auct. T. 4. 19 (s. X): of minuscule forms, 9 is from Laur. 32, 15 (Iliad D s. X), 10 from Vat. 1982 (s. XI), 11 from Grott. Ferr. B. a. i (a. 986), 12 from Angel. B. 3. 11, 13 from the Paris Demosthenes > (from the text), 14, 15 from Vat. 1298 (Aristides, s. X-XI), 16 from Vallicell, E. до (s. XI), 17 from Bodl. Roe 16, 18 from Bodl. Auct. E. 5. 9

(8. X), 19, 20 from Laud. 89 (s. XI), 21 from Roe 1 (s. XI- XIT)!, 22 from Turin В. 1. 22 (а. 1149). The abbreviation for rpa, which seems one of the peculiarities of the Grotta Ferrata school, may be illustrated Бу rpageıv from Isidore (a. 986), вета графії from Angel. B. 3. 11. It may be doubted whether sufficiently precise evidence as yet exists to prove Lehmann’s conclusions (p. 92), as to the origin and relation of the two modes of representing the syllables ap and ep.
ГІМЕТАІ. The simple contraction for rivera: acquires some interest from the varying forms under which it appears. It is most common perhaps in mathematical mss. СЁ r, 2 from the D’Orville Euclid (text), 3 from mathematical scholia to the Paris Anthology, 4 from the Paris Demos- thenes 2, 5, 6, 7 from Laur. 5, 3 (Clem. Alex. s. X).
ДЕ. The ordinary usage for the particle бе probably needs no illustration ; I may however add one or two examples to that given by Prof. Vitelli (p. 169) of the syllable de at the beginning or in the middle.of a word; viz. eibéac from the British Museum Nonnus, deyeron бебекфс бека from Vat, 1982. Rather unusual ligatures are nos. ı, 2 from Roe 16.
E. Lehmann’s article on e is thorough and practically sufficient. The waved line which in minuscule represents both ot and є is universal in the verbal endings -џеуос and -ueea, and in other combinations of the syllable ue (е. g. ueveı from the London Nonnus). But the abbreviation of e attached to other consonants is comparatively rare, and I can only cite examples from Laud. 37 (s. XII): TeAelv reAer'v кефалн oeueAnv, The spelling of the ms. is itacistic (cf. сниоіуоутес s. ec) and this particular usage may possibly be so explained ?. ! This form perhaps is analogous to those examples of ep given from Laur.

EIN, HN, IN. The proposition that the three syllables uv, ev, and ıv had originally a common sign, and that at a later period they were differentiated by the doubling of the sign, for ew, the adding of diacritic points, for tv, the original sign being appropriated to ну, is correctly stated by Lehmann, p. 55. At what time and under what cir- cumstances these steps took place cannot at present be determined ; the statistics here presented may advance the question somewhat!. Manuscripts in which ну, ew, w are represented by the single sign are: the five Arethas-mss., Euclid (a. 888), Plato (896), Lucian, Aristotle Urbin. 35, Clement (914); Clarke :2, Bodl Auct. T. 4. ro, Laur. 28, 3, Angelica B. 1. 7 (Caten. in Matth. s. X), Vat. 1298, Vallicell. C. 41 (Caten. in Iob. s. X), Grott. Ferr. B. а. iii. (з. XII). The following two differentiate ew, but have a . common sign for ну and w: Angel. B. т. 5 (Caten. in Evang. s. XI); Angel C. 4, 14 (Liban. epp, s. X-XI); the following four have a common sign for uv and w, while ew is apparently always written in full: Iliad Ven. A, Bodl. Canon. 110 (s. X ineunt,), Grott. Ferr. B. a. 1 (986), ib. B. a. iv (992)2. A late example of the use of the original sign for ew is Bodl. Auct. E. 2. 4 (1106), фёреу. On the other side, the earliest dated ms. that I know of where the duplicated sign is used for ew is the Nonnus Paris suppl. grec 469 A (a. 986)? ; cf. àmocró;ew nivew; another ms, undated but
before the twelfth century. A very remarkable usage occurs on a page of tenth-century minuscule bound up with the ms. Vallicell. Е. то. It is illus- trated in the words rep: apaprgparev kat kAnpixov, and consists in the ordinary tachygraphical sign for y. I do not know an exact parallel.
1 Prof, Vitelli thinks (p. 10, n. 3) that Lehmann's observations upon the mode of forming the compendium for «v at different periods—whether the strokes were drawn up or drawn down—need modification. I have not paid attention to the point. I may here say once and for all, that Lehmann’s statements of, and a fortiori inferences from, the usage of Nonnus, Brit. Mus. Add. mss. 18231, whether in regard of tachygraphy orthe ordinary system of abbreviation, are entirely erroneous. A correct account of the ms. is given on p. 33 sq.
2 The two Grotta Ferrata mss, where they abbreviate ew, use the proper tachygraphical symbol ; for w they use both modes of abbreviation.
8 The abbreviations of this ms. are strictly limited in number, but those that are used recur constantly. I did not find instances of iv, es, ts.

certainly not late in the tenth century, Bodl. Auct. E. 5.9, has the later usage throughout for the syllables ew, w, eıc; cf. diapépetv, ۵۸0 0 6 0, 61/6 Later dated examples are Mutin. 230! (a. 1051), фнөєїсіу; Genuens. 7 (1057), косиєіу ёстіу; Genuens. 2 (1075), árevizew; Aed. Christ. 70 (1104), oneóbew, From these instances it is plain that no more particular conclusion can be drawn than that the old system lasted long, and the new system began early ; but perhaps it may be said (1) that the abbreviation of w was, relatively to uv and ew, rare (a similar remark is made by Lehmann, p. 67), and (2) that the differentiation of ew from uv began earlier than that of w from wv.
Elz, HZ, 15. Vitelli’s observation (p. 169, n. 2) that the double sigma in the sense of ec was in use in the first half of the tenth century is more than confirmed by the Clarke Plato, where in the scholia that come from the hand of Arethas the word évotdoetc occurs with the final syllable thus represented ; in the rest of the ms. however the single sigma seems always to be found. Manuscripts in which s stands for all three syllables are the Clarke Plato, Clarke 12, and Clement Mutin. 126: it stands for нс and tc in the D'Orv. Euclid, Harl. Lucian, Vat. 1982, Iliad Ven. A, and doubtless in many other tenth-century mss.; the last four mss. appear to write the syllable ew in full?, and I think Lehmann's remark (p. 57) well-founded, that the abbreviation is, in early mss., comparatively rare; neither eic. nor tc is abbreviated (as it would seem) in Nonnus Par. suppl. grec 469 A (986). The Grotta Ferrata school use as a rule the proper tachygraphic sign for etc, but the single sigma occurs occasionally, e.g. ékepéyeic from Nonnus; the syllable tc in these mss. is usually written in full. Early examples of the ordinary double sigma аге »سم‎ Demosth. Par. 2, iueic Euclid Laur. 28, 3 (s. Х-ХІ); two dated instances are duváneic from Mutin. 230 (a. 1051), паунгорас from Воді. Auct. T. ii. 2 (a. 1066). Lastly, the

EIS. A
syllable is often enough abbreviated in the middle of a word ; сї, kexderguévar kivelogar from Clarke 12. Prof. Vitelli (12 n. I, 172 n. 2) challenges the explanation of a ligature for etc, of which he gives examples; I have found the form in Clarke 12, eic та, Laud. gr. І, eic róv, eic тойс, elc rüv, Mutin. 12 (s. XII) цісос eic rûv, Bodl. Misc. 251 (s. XII) eic tov (bis), D'Orv. x. 1. 1, 2 (Etym. Magn. s. XIV) ٠ ra, and it is evidently the sign found by Ludwich in the Hamburg ms. of Odyssey-scholia (Aristarchs Hom. Teat- kritik, ii. 698)*. In one instance, Clarke 12 Ё 189 r. cioiv (no. 1), the ligature occurs not in combination with the article, and with the sigma expressed; and this I think gives some ground for explaining the form itself as the ordinary ligature for eı plus а cross-stroke to denote abbreviation; so the scribe who used it for eiciv would have been conscious that the sigma was strictly speaking unrepresented in the compendium. To turn to ıc, the later sign with the diacritic dots occurs in Mutin. 230 (a. 1051) ouverevsıc, Bodl. Auct. T. ii 2 (a. 1066) крос, Genuens. 2. (a. 1075) avdrvwoic; but it already appears in a far earlier ms., Bodl Auct. E. 5. 9, certainly of the tenth century, e.g. тіс, иӧрфосіс. The syllable, as observed above, is in the Grotta Ferrata mss. mostly written in full, and where con- tracted represented by the strict tachygraphic symbol. An itacistic usage of the double * for tc, of the sort noticed by Vitelli, p. 11 n. r, occurs in Laud. gr. r Aorısnoi, though that this is an exception is shown by Barrisuaroc from the same ms. The sign occurs freely in the middle of words; cf. кратістє from Clarke 12, кодопмото Iliad Ven. A (scholia) The ordinary sign for uc hardly needs con- firmation. The itacistic * occurs in Laud. gr. ı already adduced ; cf. ет! гас, 670 otAc, and a marginal gloss where both usages occur together, калоптобонс фраттодонс 3. The

EINAI. To the various forms of the sign for eivai given by
Lehmann and Vitelli I add the following: nos. 1, 2 from Plato Paris 1807, which are apparently a near approach to the original form’, 3 a similar form from Vat. 1298 (Aristides, X-XI); the shape the sign assumes in the Arethas-mss. is shewn by 4 from Euclid, 5 from Plato, 6, 7 from Lucian; Demosthenes = and the Anthol. Pal. (Paris portion) offer 8 and 9, without accent or breathing, Vat. 1982 no. 10; here and in 11 from the London Nonnus, occurs the stroke for abbreviation. The horizontal type occurs in Clarke 12, no. 12 passim, Laur. 28, 3 no. 13, Grott. Ferr. B. a. iv..(a. 992) no. 14, Angelica T. 1. 8 (s. XI) no. 15, Vat. 1298 no. 16, Hermog. Paris grec 1983 (s. XI-XII) no. 17, Bodl. Misc. 251 no. 18 passim.
EN. The form which this syllable takes in the Arethas-mss. is illustrated by иёуто, боїкєу, eioeauev from the Harl. Lucian, év from Plato f. 395 У. For other tenth-century mss., cf. Bovandevra Clarke 12, meveépac Auct. E. 5. ТІ, ëv éveev Nonnus Add. 18231; cf. also èv ёутолдс from Barocc. 235 (s. XII), and the odd ligature ovdév Mutin. 230 (a. 1051). It will be observed that these forms are either right angles or slight departures therefrom. The varia- tion in which the downstroke is prolonged occurs in Vat. 1982 ëv, évrev (Vitelli, p. 9 n. 2). The strictly tachygraphical sign is by no means, rare, and is found in mss. that are not otherwise particularly tachygraphic : cf. е. g. oóxouev Auct. E. 5. тт (s. Х-ХІ) совнешеу [sic], uev, ёөєу Roe 16; further uev (bis) су (bis) órouviiconev Nonnus Add. 18231, бшлобџеу Grott. Ferr. В. а. iv. (992), иёу Aérouev kareyóuevoi Vat. 1982 ®. 1 In explaining the genesis of the original form it is difficult to accept either
Lehmann's view that the two dots come by false analogy from the sign for
Єсті, or that of Graux (Rev. Crit. 1878, Notices Bibliographiques, etc. р. 66)
by which thoy are due to the desire for symmetry. 2 And elxev, Angel. B. 3. 11, second hand.
EINAI—EZ. 15
EP. Of both the methods of representing ep there are abundant examples in older minuscule. The more common perhaps is that consisting ofa stroke, inclined to the left, but above or below the line, with a ring attached ; this is to be found in the scholia of the D'Orv. Euclid (бпер 1, пер), the Clarke Plato (бпер 2), Plato Paris 1807 (ónép bis), Laur. 28, 3 (бпер 3), Clarke 12 (бтерволну), Mutin. 126 (бпер 3, бпер 4), Vat. 1298 (бпер 4), Mutin. 193, Lucian s. XI-XII. (єїпер), Mutin. 12, s. XII. (ómep, пер), and throughout in the Grotta Ferrata school, е. g. suveproi Nonnus, сперџа G. F. B. a. i., depuarivouc Angel. В. 3. 11, ónép ф0су G. F. B. a. iv., бпер cnep ib. В. a. iii. The second mode, the simple cross-stroke, of whatever origin, may be seen in the text of the D'Orv. Euclid (énep), often in the scholia to the Clarke Plato (Фопер ómep ómép), in those to Demosthenes > (&onep 2, бпер 2), and it occurred in the now lost ‘ codex
_ Vallae’ of Archimedes’. I have suggested under rop a parallel to the form quoted by Vitelli, p. 15.
ЕХ. The normal use of the sign for ec (е. р. as in vır@vrec from the Harl. Lucian) is well established ; it is less com- mon to find it either in the middle of a word or upon the line. Of the former case revéceat àpéckew from Clarke 12, étecttv from Auct. E. 5. 11 are examples; for the latter one may compare uátavrec Plato Par. 1807, леоутес Mutin. 126, deomöraı Angel.

The itacism by which the double apostrophe, ordinary representative of aıc, is employed for ec, of which Vitelli gives some instances, p. 12, is more widely spread than is commonly supposed, and occurs in mss. of a good age and often otherwise carefully written; such are the well-known Laur.

EZTAI, One of the most interesting of Greek compendia, and that may almost be said to have been discovered since the appearance of Lehmann's handbook, is the sign that represents ¿ora—almost technical in geometrical mss., but occurring with a certain frequency in mss. of other subjects. The sign was originally found by Bast in the ms. S. Germ. 249 (Comm. Pal, p. 810), and this is the only instance that Lehmann has before him ; Prof. Vitelli (p. 168) has found it in the Laur. Aeschylus, the Aristotle Paris grec 1853, and the Euclid Laur. 28. 3. The oldest instance that I am able to give of it is the Fragmentum mathematicum Bobiense, f 114 v. 30 in Belger's copy, Hermes XVI, where Belger misreads it dpa’. Next it is used in most of the Arethas-mss.; the Bologna Euclid Archiginnasio A. r. 18? has it, and doubtless most other mathematical mss. before the twelfth century; lastly, it is one of the many compendia used by the scribe of the Bodleian Epictetus Misc. 251 (s XII). Hence we get the following chain: ı Frag. Bobiense, 2-4 D'Orv. Euclid (text), 5 ib. (scholia), 6 Plato, 7 Lucian, 8 Urbin. Aristotle, 9-12 forms from Laur. 28, 3 rather different to the one given by Vitelli, 13-16 from the Bologna Euclid, 17-20 from the Bodl. Epictetus. I enclose in brackets Prof. Vitell's no. 53 for greater completeness. On comparing these forms with those given by Bast and Vitelli, it appears (1) that the dots signifying т are absent and present indifferently in mss. of the same age; (2) that, with this qualification, the original form is best represented
by the type given by the Bobbio fragment and the text 1 I have to defer the proof of this statement, but its truth will be evident
to anyone who tries to read the passage grammatically. ? Heiberg's b, saec. xi.
EZTAI—K, 17
of the D’Orville Euclid, and that the letters contained in the sign are therefore (т) + а + the tachygraphic ı either attached to or crossing the downstroke of а!. (з) The late forms 17-20 are direct descendants of no. 1; the transition from one type to the other will be plain if we imagine such a form as Vitelli's no. 53 written with the curve open instead of closed. His no. 39 I should be inclined to explain as due to carelessness on the part of the scribe, but in any case it does not disturb the general result ?.
I. The curious expedient of representing, in late manu- scripts, iota by two dots on a level with each other, is well known, but not so universal that it may not be worth while illustrating from four dated mss.; viz. xou- narıkdv from Coll. Nov. 258 (a. 1298 written by Demetrius Triclinius) where the usage is frequent, џуновнт. from a note in Roe 1 that bears the date 1417, rewpriw from Mutinensis 118 (a. 14?8)?, and xovreaéovri from Vat. Ottobon. 58 (a. 1538).
INA, A simple contraction for iva, consisting of an iota with a mark of abbreviation beneath it, occurs in three mss. of my observation: Angel T. r. 8 (s. XI), Vallicell. E. до (s. XI) and the Bodleian Epictetus, Misc. 251 (s. ХП). The form is practically the same in all three *.
K. The article in Lehmann shows well how the waved line, descendant of the original tachygraphic «, represents final
- ! Lehmann's analysis (p. 104) comes near to this, though in the single form given by Bast it was impossible to perceive the direct presence of the a. (Since the article on ¿ora was written, I have found instances of both the plain and the dotted form in the Aristotle Ven. 201 of д.р. 955. In either case the form was open, and the example is important as an indication of the age at which this tendency manifested itself.)
2 To Lehmann's account of сат! little exception is to be taken; I doubt how- ever his statement (p. 102) that the horizontal line over ./. in Vat. 1£09 denotes v—surely it is the general sign of omission. Curious representations of the word are no. ı from G. F. B. a. iii, no. 2 from Laud. gr. 1 (s. XII).
3 On the date I must refer to my notes on the Estense in the Classical Review for February, 1889.
* It is to be seen also in Vallicell. E. 63 (s. XII), a ms. in a hand not unlike that of the Bodleian Epictetus, and is probably common.

syllables beginning with «, chiefly but not exclusively ter- minations in -кӧс, etc. The usage is very constant in mss. that I have seen: cf. Їстрікн, Фрединтикн, етивоџнткф Plato Clarke 39, іаивікос Clarke 12, помітікду Auct. E. 5. 9, Өєорнтікоб Nonnus Add. 18231. Nonnus however usually exhibits the case-termination, e.g. ёкклноіастікӣс, drreAaorikHv, одк Фтибекткос; so also шерікну Auct. E. 5.91. Instances of terminations other than -kóc are галактос Clarke Plato, шкрбу Auct. E. 5. 9, егрнкеу, érivockov, кака Laud. gr. т, ua- крбу Laur. 32. 15 (Iliad D), éBeounkovréxic Demosth. Paris 22.
KATA. Neither Lehmann nor Prof. Vitelli (p. 15) has given much illustration of the modes of representing ката. One may distinguish (1) partial abbreviation, where (a) the « is tachygraphically rendered ; so ката I катоурфвас often in the London Nonnus, кота 2 karerdeı (sic) Clarke 12, ката 3 and 4 Laur. 28, 3, karé 5 Vat. 1298 š, or (Б) the abbreviation is confined to the other letters. A few examples will suffice to illustrate this; сЁ kará o karabiókew Bodl. Auct. E. 5. 9, кота то Demosthenes 2, ката 11, 12 Vat. 1298, кататну Angel, T. 1. 8 (s. XI), where the pair of dots appear to do double duty. (2) Complete abbreviation, the proper tachygraphical sign; e.g. korobvouéva Clarke 12, karageeipe: Vat. 1982. The sign is universal in the more tachygraphical parts of Nonnus, but does not occur in as much of the ms. as is written in minuscule 4.
^. Lehmann's account of the origin and usage of the con- traction for syllables beginning with Lambda is de- servedly commended by Graux, Rev. Crit. 1880, Notices Bibliographiques, ete., p. 165. His examples however admit

largely of multiplication. The use occurs, though rarely, in the Arethas-ms., e.g. okaAuvóv, ісоскєлёс Plato, mörıc Lucian ; other tenth-century examples are паблос, пбмс, 7۷ Clarke 12, kepdaaıov dureAov Demosth. 2, суолну, Вас 4۷ Nonnus Paris suppl. grec 469 A, параволну Iliad Ven. А; in all of these instances it will be noticed how the right stroke of the Л 18 prolonged. Freer examples from the same century are етистолну Auct. E. 5. о (but б ämöoroxoc ib.) телос, подлос, Bacuveóc Auct. E. 5. 11. The Grotta Ferrata school use the contraction not unfrequently : so коклос, етистолћс, kovoravrivoróAeoc Nonnus, йпботолої G. Е. B. а. і. Lastly, a few eleventh-century mss. may be cited: Laud. gr. 39, Selden supr. ті, Laud. gr. 1 (the eccentric form тоб | 8۱86٨٥6 ۰(. I add a somewhat more interesting example, веолбгоџ, from Phot. Bibl. Ven. 450 (s. X).
.MEN. The Bodleian ms. of the poems of Gregory Nazianzen, Clarke 12 saec. X? so often already cited, has not un- frequently the tachygraphical symbol for uev, whether the particle or a syllable in a word ; so uév f. 157 v., uevoöv ib. et saep., евнраваџеу 176 у. For other tachygraphical usages of this ms. v. under кота and re*.
OMOY. One of the most curious signs that still remain for the palaeographer to analyse is that occurring in some manuscripts for öuoo. Lehmann s.v. has collected the quotations of it by earlier enquirers and Gitlbauer (Vat. 1809). Vitelli does not notice it. The form occurs in mss. by no means tachygraphie, and even where the percentage
! It may be worth noticing that the simple contraction for Aóyos and ita compounds is freely used in the Arethas-mss. I give as types ó Aóyos, Aóyov, Adyous, dXoyov, eUdoyos, kawódoyos, from the Harl. Lucian. Further cf. Aóyos 2, Aóyov 2, dhóyos from Grott. Ferr. B. a. i.
? Both Graux, Rerue Critique 1878, p. 124, and Vitelli, l.c. p. 161, n. 2 have demanded information upon the stichometry of this ms. It may be well therefore to say here briefly, that the number of oriyo is in this case precisely the number of verses in the poems.
* See also infra under Par. grec 990, p. 38 (for the syllable ue).
4 A contraction for peragú which I cannot satisfactorily explain occurs in the Clarke Plato f. 377 v. Harl Lucian f. 73 v.; cf. the instance in the table. Otherwise (Frag. Bobiense, D'Orv. Euclid) pera£ó is represented by M.

of ‘ordinary’ abbreviation is not great; it is most common perhaps in mathematical mss., but it occurs in others also where it is necessary to add up a total. It consists of two parallel strokes crossed by a single one, and may either have the rough breathing and circumflex or be without either; and in late mss. the accent and breathing are run together into a single waved line (so Lehmann rightly analyses it). In Vat. 1809 the single stroke is vertical, and the two crossing it horizontal", but later the form is that given in the table: viz. no. 1 Bologn. Archigin. A. 1. 18 (Euclid, s. XI) 2 Mutin. 71 (Synaxarium, s. XI-XII), 3 Vat. 191 (cire. 1404, var. mathemat), 4 Mutin. 55 (Synesius, etc. s. XV). A curious form, distortion or misapprehension, is no. 5 from Laud. gr. 39 (s. XI ineunt.) телос Kavóvov тфу Ev vikala’ бџоб K?2,
ON. Two additions may be made to the otherwise very full article of Lehmann's upon ov. (1) The illegitimate use of the double stroke in the sense of the single (Lehm. p. 73) occurs as early as Laud. gr. 1°, e.g. фолаттоутас, џбуоу, йруоутєс. (2) The single stroke is not so seldom met with in the middle of words as Lehmann's examples suggest; it is common in the Arethas-mss.: cf. áraróvrec from Euclid, rat;ovrec Plato, ёкоутєс Lucian +,
02. To the examples given by Prof. Vitelli (p. 11, n. 4) of the tachygraphical sign for oc in ordinary mss. I add some instances from Barocc. 26 (s. XI ineunt.), a ms. that offers some other peculiarities of contraction? ; viz. апостолос f. 249 1., ёуєргодутос 338 v., npóc 198 v., б абтбс тогуџу Aóroc 182 ۰
! An identical form appears to be presented in the Frag. Bobiense, f. 114 v. 26, ap. Belger Hermes XVI, but it must be admitted that certainty as to its meaning is difficult. Other instances of the compendium are no. 6 from Par. 990, no. 7 from Vat. 904 (s. XIII), no. 8 from Vat. 1319 (s. XV).

Another mode of expressing oc, little noticed hitherto, is by an uncial sigma, cf. from Laud. gr. 39 &kaoroc, прос, пері тоб maparedevroc and оуібматікфу ; further Aóroc катафатик с Nonnus add. 18231, mpöc буос Grott. Ferr. B. а. iv. (a. 992), їктерос Bodl. Auct. T. r. 2 (s. XI ineunt). These examples may go some way toward resolving Lehmann's doubt (p. 75) about the meaning of the sigma in the two words that he quotes from Sabas !.
OYN. Illustration of this common compendium, whether as the particle or the syllable, is hardly needful. I take almost at random koAoüvraı, опос обу from the D'Orv. Euclid, оду I from the Clarke Plato, oöv 2 from Par. grec suppl. 469 A, and the unusual ligature pepatodvroc, оду from Barocc. 21 (s. XII). Of the genesis of the symbol I do not remember to have met with any account; Lehmann (p. 76) leaves
` the question open. If however we compare this ordinary sign for ovv with the tachygraphic symbol for ev (v. supra), it is plain that they have one part in common, namely the crooked stroke that concludes either compendium: this stroke therefore, in either case, may be taken to repre- sent v, and while the open curve in ev will stand for e, that which is closed in ovv may similarly be inferred to represent o”,

The difference consists in a hook at the top of the upstroke, cf. параскеону, rrapadeırnarıköc, пора 12 from Vat. 1298; it is curious that these forms, if the semi-circle were wanting, would be almost exactly like those given by Prof. Vitelli (p. 14) from Laur. 32, 9 and Laur. 59, 9 (plate nos. 7, 24, 25). An exaggeration of this variation appears to be the form mopá r3 which I take from Angel. C. 4. 15 (Liturgiae, a. 1165). Lastly, the singular form пара 14 Angel. T. 1. 8 (s. XI) must apparently be explained as an individual error of the scribe's, who had (v. s. T) some acquaintance with tachygraphy.
ПРОХ. I have not seen the sign for прос in the Arethas- scholia, and it will probably be found not to occur; its place is taken by пр. It is constant however in the teat of the D'Orville Euclid (Stephanus) — a large and characteristic form: cf. nos. 1-4.

The representation of + by two dots placed over or across the following vowel or syllable is one of the most characteristie and consistently carried out practices of Greek tachygraphy, and is found in mss, otherwise of the ordinary type of writing far more often than is usually supposed. It is in fact often the only trace of tachygraphy that a ms. wil show. The scanty account in Lehmann has been greatly added to by Prof. Vitelli (ra, p. 11, 170, rac 11, 32,

YTO. А tachygraphical contraction for ómó occurs more frequently than for ónep but without being itself common. There appear to be two distinct symbols in use: (1) one, already known from tachygraphy, and frequent in the Grotta Ferrata mss. : so ‘пб 1 G. F. B. а, xix, ónó 2 nò rfc ömovolaıc Nonnus, úrrozóriov Angel. B. 3. 11, бпб 3 Par. 990?. (2) Another sign, quite unlike the former, already quoted by Bast (p. 794) from S. Germ. 249, is identical inshape with the symbol for ànó (q. v.) so largely used by the Grotta Ferrata school, and only distinguished from it by the breathing, or in fact, where the breathing is ambiguous or incorrect, by the context, Certain instances are бпобекуџоута, 67۵ kako0, 676 4 from the Bodl Epictetus, Misc. 251; the same form is probably given by Vat. 1982 in опобєвєїса (sine spir.), and further by a late mathematical ms., Vat. тот circ. 1404, imo 5 (sic). The fact of one compendium standing for both ano and ónó at once suggests that the letters actually denoted by the sign must be those common to both words, viz. n + o ; and though I do not hold this conjecture proved, especially as regards the o, it may at all events strengthen the con- clusion arrived at by Lehmann (p. 84) from consideration ої ёпо alone.
QN. Under this head I have to notice the tachygraphic sign, rightly described by Lehmann at the beginning of his article as a waved line; it is in fact not unlike an open omega inverted. In this form it is used by an ancient hand
! The argumentation between Gitlbauer and Lehmann (Lehm. p. 88) upon the origin and relation of the signs for úrép and úró, does not perhaps admit of proof or disproof; but it may be allowable to suggest another hypothesis that appears at least as probable. Lehmann justly doubts Gitlbauer's half- revolution of the sign for úrép as a preliminary to explaining it; but his own analysis of it, and especially his theory of the original identity of the two signs, appear to me no less arbitrary. A simple comparison of the common letters in imép, (тб, with the common strokes in the two compendia suggests that (1) the left-hand stroke in олер is p, while the left-hand stroke in 6 is o (the tachygraphic o is a line bent into two curves); (2) that the right- hand cross-stroke in either case is a mere mark of abbreviation, to erect the letters p and o into substantive symbols for ómép and úré. For an analogy I may refer to my own analysis of the strange sign for es (p. 12).

Cf. also тфу véov Vat. 1982, ràv Өєорнибтоу, TOV áriov Mutin. 121, Early dated examples of the coalescence of the circumflex accent with the ordinary sign (Vitelli p. 10, n. 2) are тфу Genuens. 2 (a. 1075), vvyóv Angel.

A few instances of the compendium for this syllable, to be added to those given by Vitelli (pp. 15, 32, 171) are: púrop Clarke Plato, гєоргікду Harl Lucian (both in the scholia), ёктор Iliad Laur. 32, 15 (text), uurponórop Laur. 5, 3 (not cited, I think, by Prof. Vitelli), бупанптор Laud. gr.

ОХ. The examples that I give of ac are meant to illustrate its form and its position with regard to the line, (1) The slight variation by which the last curve of the sign takes a turn upwards, is, as Bast notices, a peculiarity of the strongly-marked writing of the Plato Paris grec 1807 (cf. фс I, обтос, ёттікдс), but it is found also in the text of the D’Orville Euclid f, 120 v. aúroc, and it existed in the ‘ codex Vallae' of Archimedes from which Angel. C. 2. 6 was copied; cf. the passage in the plate from f. 222 v. explaining wc and пос? (2) The syllable is found written on the line most constantly in mss. more or less connected with tachygraphy, e. g. oóroc Nonnus, ۵۰٥ Angel. B. 3. 11, фосєос Grott. Ferr. B. a. iv, Фопер ib.

Another instance of this form of os is opens Vat. 2 в. XI). м E beginner may with profit contemplate the fourth example of ós in

QSTIEP. I do not remember to have seen or read of a single sign for Хопер; the separate abbreviation of either syllable is of course frequent enough. A ligature, consisting of the tachygraphical signs for both syllables interlaced, is given by the ms. Etym. Magn. D'Orville x. 1. 1, 2 s. XIV, of which a facsimile is prefixed to Gaisford's edition of the E. M.; cf. no. 1 from f. 289 v., no. 2 from 288 r. ; both are at the end of the line.

Таснусварну. It has’ been often pointed out that in "Greek minuscule and late uncial writing there are two systems of abbreviation in use at once: one, of rare oc- currence and of obviously tachygraphic origin, the other, far commoner, and though also ultimately tachygraphic in source, so familiar as to be known by contrast as the ‘ordinary’ system. Facts as to the coincidences and di- vergencies of the two systems are well given by Lehmann in his introductory chapters, and a masterly sketch of the subject, with illustrations, will be found in Graux' review of Gardthausen, Journal des Savants 1881, p. 312 вд. The extent to which the * tachygraphic ' system entered into the writing of ordinary books is one of the questions in palaeo- graphy which most stand in need of additional evidence. That the system was far more widely spread and more generally used in books than was commonly supposed, there

can be no doubt; but whether any principle governed its employment, and whether any place, persons or style of author can be connected with it, must for the present remain an open question. One of the few facts known for certain is that the later tachygraphical system was practised by monks of the order of S. Basil, and in especial by the Basilian school of Grotta Ferrata near Rome. Of the eleven manuscripts whose usage I proceed to summarise, seven were certainly written at Grotta Ferrata, one may have been, and another, though written elsewhere, was the work of a Basilian 1,
(1) An account of the history of the school of S. Nilo at Grotta, Ferrata, the monastery and village between Frascati and Marino on the lower slopes of the Alban Hills, is to be looked for in the Prolegomena that are to complete the
` catalogue not long since published by the learned librarian of the Abbey, P. Antonio Rocchi?. In the mean time it may be convenient to say that San Nilo, the founder of the monastery at the close of the tenth century, established therewith a school and style of writing. The school may be said to continue, at least in the person of the Diblio- thecarius, to the present day ; the distinctive characteristics of the handwriting of S. Nilo? may be traced, in mss. written by his disciples, for more than a generation. Manuseripts with which I am acquainted that exhibit this type of writing are, beside the three books in the hand of S. Nilo himself (B. o. xix, xx, xxi), two mss. still in the monastery, B. o. i and B. a. iv, one in the Biblioteca

The type loses its chief characteristics in the twelfth century, but still exists as a particularly neat and close minuscule; authentic examples are В. o. iii, and the latter part of Angelica B.3. 11. I have imagined resemblances in Mutinensis r2 and Bodl. Вам). 156. It has always been well known that S. Nilo’s disciples were tachygraphers, and the two great examples of their production in this direction, Vat. 1809 and Brit. Mus. add. 18,231 have been more or less carefully examined; but for our knowledge of the codices that still remain in the Abbey we still depend practically upon Montfaucon and Piacentini. A stay of five days at Grotta Ferrata in May of last year (1888) gave me opportunity to inspect the library with this purpose. I have to thank Padre Rocchi's benevolence not only for access to the manuscripts that he knows so well, but for the arrangements that he was good enough to undertake for my entertainment in the village. May he accept an im- perfect, acknowledgment of one of the pleasantest weeks that have fallen to the writer's experience.
The three mss. in the hand of S. Nilo (a. 965) are un- abbreviated. On the last four pages however of B. a. xix occur a considerable number of compendia; most noticeable tachygraphically are Јпер (опер tod лаоб), отб, and ١ in й ۴٨ rvösıc. Тһе last sign is one of the rarest of those in use by the school, and will probably hardly exist elsewhere than in the purely tachygraphical parts of Vat. 1809 and Nonnus and, in ordinary writing, in Vallicell. D. 43. The other mss. appear to give the syllable always in full. Vat. 1982 gives the common sign, v. s. Е! (aste).

Nilo is to be recognised there also: it is of course well known, independently of the hand, that the ms. came from Grotta Ferrata. Lastly, from the description given by Graux (Arch. des Missions, etc. 3°. ser. V. p. 123) of the ms. O. 74 of the Biblioteca Nacional at Madrid it would seem that it also belonged to the ‘Scuola di san Nilo.’
TACHFGRAPHF. 31
containing works by Gregory Nazianzen with the com- ment of Nonnus, has for some years past been known to offer extensive examples of tachygraphy; I need not refer to the passages in the handbooks where it is noticed, nor to the facsimiles of pages in the various collections. It may be said to exhibit three styles of writing: (a) min- uscule: the text, only rarely abbreviated, and various introductions, indices, etc. (ff. 4 V., 12, 13, 14 V., 15 r., 318 r.— 330 v.) which on the contrary are very closely contracted; (b) scholia in large semi-uncial, which, beginning almost without contractions, gradually increase the percentage of signs till they almost reach pure tachygraphy ; (c) purely tachygraphical marginal remarks, glosses and corrections. In this article I deal with tachygraphy only in so far as it is introduced into ordinary writing, and therefore it is only the first of these three classes that I here notice. It is to be hoped indeed that the whole tachygraphical contents of the ms. may some day be made publie, but I offer here nothing beyond a collection of the tachygraphical signs that are found in the minuscule part of it. The ms. was written, it is well known, in 972, but the writer has not given his name. Lehmann (p. 53) has rightly concluded, from a comparison of facsimiles, that it belongs to the Grotta Ferrata school, and the resemblance is obvious to anyone who has been both at London and Grotta Ferrata ; but he is certainly wrong in identifying the scribe with Paul who wrote the Isidore. The editors of the Palaeogra- phieal Society, who in their forthcoming fasciculus publish several facsimiles of Grotta Ferrata mss., decide that the hand of Nonnus is the same as that of the Angelica Theodoretus, to be noticed below ; and there is a clear difference of writing between these mss. and the Isidore. A graver fault, however, with regard to this ms. has been committed by Lehmann, than the wrong identi- fication of its hand. Relying upon the evidence of the facsimile of a single page, he has in various places of his book made general statements of the usage of the entire
32 ABBREVIATIONS IN GREEK MANUSCRIPTS,
ms.—which are wrong ; and based upon them theories as to the history of Tachygraphy, which are necessarily even further from the truth. It is sufficient to warn anyone who uses the book that the statements in pp. 21, 22, 53, 54, 57, 67,as to the representations in the Nonnus of the syllables ем, tv, etc, are incorrect. The matter is the most serious blot in a meritorious handbook, and a conspieuous example of the results of ‘ Palaeography from Facsimiles.'
The manuscript then, inthis part of it, exhibits specifically tachygraphical signs for the following syllables: at, atc, бпо, ap, Etv, ev, Em, цу, оо, пара, та, THY, -T° Єсті, тос, 06 ото. Cf the words patdpdrare, ebyaic, dd, órrápyew, cuumpár- теу, катбуєгкєу, émikaeicac, éreotv, obbeic, iovdatoc, THV Te, ro0r' ёсті, oUroc, бпер, Úmovoiare, Here the frequent use of at, atc, ew, ім and especially ov, is noticeable; the last compendium occurs in “ordinary writing, only in the mss. Vallieell. D. 43 and Par. 090. The curiously consistent contraction for тобт ¿ori also deserves notice ; in the semi- uncial scholia the words are still farther abbreviated. Otherwise the use of the symbol for Tav is singularly limited. The other signs are more or less characteristic of the school For instances of rà v. anfes. A; the usage of the manuscript for op, eivaı, єр, «ard, пара has also been previously illustrated. Lehmann's statement that ıc in this ms. is always written in full, is true to the extent that the tachygraphical sign does not occur in this part of the ms.; in the scholia and the pure tachygraphie glosses it is common, and in the minuseule part itself the ordinary sign sometimes represents the syllable: v. ante s. 610. The sign for ts, as I have already noticed, is very rare in all the Grotta Ferrata school.
(3) The Biblioteca Angelica at Rome possesses one ms. of the school of Grotta Ferrata, Theodoretus B. 3. 11. The book consists of two parts, of which the first is of the tenth century, the second of the eleventh or twelfth. A description of it will be found in my notes on the Angelica

shortly to appear in the Classical Review, and in the current fasciculus of the Palaeographical Society, where a facsimile of a page from the first part is given. This earlier hand is the same, Mr. Maunde Thompson tells me, as that of the London Nonnus of A.D. 972; it is very con- siderably abbreviated. "The second hand, though later, is not without traces of tachygraphy, v. ante s. EN. The tachygraphical signs used by the first hand are as follows: at (omuaiver), atc (ruuoptoic), dro (ante), ар (id.), ew (Tuyeiv), eic. (нџетс, oúdeic), em (Emtkaréowvrat), ep (ante), w (baktvewov), пара (ante), опер (id.), бто (id.).
(4) The well-known Isidore, B. а. 1, written in 986 by Paul, second Abbot of Grotta Ferrata, offers the following dis- tinctively tachygraphical signs: at (скомаї), aic. (біавнкайс) . ap, and combinations of a with other letters (ante), dro (ante), єї (baudze) 1, ew (6patvew), èm (émevulow), ep (ante), гу (докногу), пара (ante), отер (бпер Aórov). It is curious that neither here nor in Angel. B. 3. 11 is there any employment of the double dots for r which are so frequent in most mss. that are at all tachygraphic. The scribe uses the ordinary system of abbreviation freely, and the total proportion of contracted words is large.
(5) It was my good fortune to have brought to me in the Biblioteca Vallicelliana at Rome, one day in February of this year, a Latin ms. numbered D. 43, of the Dialogues of S. Gregorius Magnus, saec. XI, at the end of which were bound up two leaves of a Greek ms. in the writing of Grotta Ferrata. A photograph of one leaf was sent to Pre. Rocchi at the Monastery, and he was afterwards good enough to examine the ms. itself. His conclusion as to the hand is, I am happy to say, a confirmation of what sug- gested itself to me at first sight: that the writer is Paul, monk of Grotta Ferrata, the scribe of the Isidore D. а, 1.

The subject-matter is harder to determine; the leaves con- tain, as a librarian’s note on the first of them and at the beginning of the ms. says, ‘fragmentum indicis codicis antiqui, but the work to which the index was prefixed Pre. Rocchi was unable to discover; it was probably, in his opinion, a commentary on part of the New Testament, possibly S. Paul's Epistles.
The interest however of the fragment is palaeographical. The leaves, numbered 88 and 89, measure 102 x 8 in., are in double columns with 44 lines in each; they together form one sheet of vellum, and, the text being continuous, must therefore have been the middle leaves of a quire; the flesh-side of the vellum is outward, the rulings are on the hair-side. The writing is above the line. The abbrevia- tions are extraordinarily numerous; both in this respect and for the rarity of some of the symbols used, no other piece of * ordinary writing' at present known to have come from Grotta Ferrata can compare with these two pages. The following list gives the tachygraphical signs that I have found: а, at, oic, ava, опо, ар, etc, єк, emi, ep, ест, є101, eivat, IV, їс, ov, пара, тоб ]?ёсті, ruv, опер, опо: cf. the words коб бт, qaiverat, vepédatc, будагеууфутаи, аподниєї, &mapyH, сафєїс, екднџе! ékróc, ётіфоцубиєуоо, jerepyouévouc, Єсті, eici, eivat, сітобоїу, Өєшїс, обк, VOOUMEVOC, пара, тобтєсті, параватну, únep, бподолоу. Of these signs four are of great rarity, dvo, ёк, 1с, ou: of дуа I do not know another instance in ordinary bookhand ; Nonnus has it, but in the tachygraphical por- tion : ёк occurs also in Vat. 1982 and Par. grec 990: tc, as I have already observed, is found elsewhere only in G. F. B. т. xix, and ov only in Nonnus and Par. gree 990. It is instructive to compare the amount of abbreviation used by the same scribe in these two mss., G. F. B. а. ı and Vallicell. D? 5.

· (8) Montfaucon Pal. Graec. p. 283 gives a facsimile of а manuscript in the house of the Basilian order at Rome. The entire collection once belonging to this order is well known to be now in the Vatican, where it is incorporated under the ‘ Vaticani graeci, beginning at 1962. The par- ticular ms. intended by Montfaucon 1s, as I have found out, Vat. 1982 or Basil 21. Its description is as follows: membr, 8 x 5) in., ff. 223; ff. 1-189 are in ordinary script, 36 lines on a page, in a rather small good eleventh-century hand below the line, only slightly contracted ; ff. r9o r., 190 У., 191 r., being blank leaves of the same book, are filled with contemporary semi-tachygraphic writing, con- taining on 190 r. and v. various medical receipts, on 190 v. 191 r. an extract from Chrysostom (inc. та гар плејста тфу ápapruudrov), 191 v. is blank. Ff. 192-223 are apparently a different book, in a much smaller but contemporary hand, much abbreviated, 29 lines to the page, containing S. Basil's Aöroı on various portions of scripture, the first being that on Psalm VTI which Montfaucon facsimiled ; it is defective at the end. The book may have come from Grotta Ferrata, but was certainly not written there, for on a modern fly-leaf at the beginning is the inscription Ex libris MS. 6

S. Helie Carbonensis? Nullius Dioecesis, Anglonen. Ordinis S. Basilii Magni, and the hand bears not the slightest re- semblance to that of the famous Isidore of Grotta Ferrata ; it is in fact hard to see what can have suggested their identity to Montfaucon >.
The ms. appears to use the following tachygraphical signs: atc (mapowliarc), av (évravea), dro (amd тфу), de (ante), ёк (no. т), èv (ante), em (етивошас), ка (both with a dot, as karexómevor, and without, as KaAAıpwviac), кар (карбіа), ката (катафвегре!), 6 уаз pap (биортнибтоу), ба (битове!ва), та, тас, TEC, TOIC, TOV, тос, TOU, тоос, TO, TOV, 6 (ante), ото С ову wv (ШИ; see m under A, ДЕ, EINAI, EIC, ПАРА. The most noticeable points are the use of some quite rare forms, such as ёк, ка, кар, ма, шар, oa (ua and oa very frequently), the series of r-syllables, and the absence of signs? for at, ew, uv, etc, їс, бтер, úno (in the more usual form, cf. ante), syllables which are so common in the Grotta Ferrata school I add a phrase that I cannot at present decipher, from f. 190 r; the words immediately preceding are табта ۸6۵506 б сотнр.
(9) À manuscript in the Estense at Modena, ii. A. 12, S. Maximus de caritate, shows some tachygraphieal in- fluence: it is of the eleventh to twelfth century, membr. 54x 4in., ff. 135, in two hands, of which it is the former (ff. 1-56) that is partly tachygraphical The non-tachy- graphie abbreviations are uniformly of the later type: e.g. those for etc, іс, ew, w (q. v. ante). Tachygraphic signs occur for ap (варкос), їм (rvdow, послу), пара (ante), Ta, Tec, rov (ante), ov (doréwv); the most noticeable of these is that for w, which is very frequent. This hand is upright and well-formed, and bears some resemblance to the twelfth-

century type of Grotta Ferrata hand, as shown in B. а, iii. The second hand is quite dissimilar.
(10) I have next to mention a ms. that has long been famous in the history of Greek tachygraphy—that of Hermogenes at Paris, which is now numbered grec 3032. From this book Montfaucon took his *notae rhetoricae et oratoriae omnium lectu difficillimae, which for more than a century were the only published examples of Greek shorthand ; they reappeared, as is well known, with an improved interpretation in Kopp's ‘Palaeographia Critica, in 1817. It is not however with this venerable material that I have to concern myself. The book falls into two parts, the text and the marginal annotations, and it is the . latter that Montfaucon published and Kopp revised. Of the text, on the other hand, no account hitherto has been taken; it offers nevertheless considerable palaeographical interest.
The ms. is a small vellum book, pp. 152, of no doubt the tenth century, in quaternions, written, mostly below the line, in a small upright ornamental minuscule, con- siderably ligatured; in the margin, not very constantly, are annotations in pure tachygraphy in the same hand as that of the text, and in characters quite as large. We have therefore an instance of what may be called the normal case for the introduction of tachygraphy into book- hand; the case namely where a scribe accustomed to prac- tise the tachygraphical system sets himself to write a book for the purposes of an ordinary reading public. For much the greater proportion of his text, abbreviation of any sort is excluded ; but at times, and especially at the ends of lines, it is legitimate, and it is inevitable that here, a scribe who is cognisant of tachygraphy will borrow signs from it as well as from the system of abbreviation ordinarily in use, Mss. of the sort are the London Nonnus, where the text is as a rule written out in full, not however without a diligent inspection of ends of lines yielding a fair return of

tachygraphical symbols, and the second part of Angel. B. 3. 11, where the tradition of the school manifests itself in the same manner in a twelfth-century hand.
This is precisely what has happened in the ms. in question, Par. grec 3032. The text is on the whole little contracted, but frequently at the ends of lines, and occa- sionally in the body of the paragraph, the scribe allows himself to shorten a word, adopting the same system as that in which he afterwards wrote his marginal comments. A considerable number therefore of signs usually considered tachygraphical may be taken from the text of this ms. I enumerate those that I have found, adding that as my study both of this and the following ms. was short, the list must not be considered exhaustive. Syllables represented are: a (düvanaı), апо (дповлепо), apa (ара), vou (aicyivov), ot (боблог), оу (тбу, філіптоу), oc (nAReoc), бті (bis), с (mapadeir- џатос), tat (stat), rav (órav), то (тобто), ov (mAórov). У. also s. OYC.
(11) Another tachygraphical Paris ms., grec 990, has been indicated and in part described by Ch. Graux, in the bril- liant sketch of Greek Tachygraphy to which I have already referred, Journal des Savants, 1881, pp. 316, 317. I learn from M. Omont that there is no likelihood of the complete study of the ms., which is there promised, being published, and I therefore take the opportunity of giving here such further particulars as I was able to gather during a short inspection of the ms. I lament that my account is not fuller, and does not better take the place of the authori- tative study that was to have been expected of the re- gretted French palaeographer; but, as tachygraphy now stands, the addition of even a handful of new forms is worth making, especially when, as in the present instance, there are at hand the means for reproduction.
_ The ms. is dated тозо, and is of the ordinary minuscule of that period; there is nothing in the character of the hand to suggest the tachygraphical knowledge of the
TACHFGRAPHF. 39
scribe. The ordinary compendia that are used, e.g. for atc, ew, exhibit the later stage of the forms. The ms. con- tains the poems of 5. Gregory Nazianzen with a prose paraphrase, in parallel columns ; it is in the paraphrase, according to the necessities of space, as Graux clearly describes, that the abbreviations occur. I have observed the following, to which must be added the forms already quoted by Graux, the most interesting of which are по and doc:
at (иороіуоутес), atc (dvoiaic), ٨٥ (офФалиодс), Arro (¿mo orépHotc), au (mavoeraı), ел (ВеЛтістоу), йти (no. т), ep (парер- xerat), eu (пуебџа), їм (kaAo0cw), ка (кателавеу), kai (no. 2), ката (каталаџвауо), ue (no. 3 era), ot (дуєшог), óuo€ (no. 4), ov
- (бутос, тбу), ov (ovveABoVokc), пау (mávroc), pav (no. 5 kepauvóc), та (пдута, тодта, Úrrepeidwnara), rat (фоВобутал), rac (катафо- Boövrac), тоо (v. табта above), те (réxvoic, Huereporc), 6 (tHe BoAosoHc), ro (mporoká8ebpo)), тос (roic дікаїоіс), rov (фвартбу, tov), roc (клопеутос), тою (тод ypiorov), то» (бионто), тоу (poırwvrwv), тос (обтос), бто (отд тну), ov (dedv).
А remark or two upon some of these forms may be in place; to discuss the ms. as a whole will need more complete examination. The syllables ал, ea, ue, pav are of very great rarity. I do not know if parallels can be quoted from any ms. but Vat. 1809 and Add. mss. 18231. The form о! is illustrated by Graux 1. c., and by Vitelli Spic. Fiorent. pp. 13, 168 : it must still be called rare. The form ev has been found by Martin in the scholia to the Ravenna Aristophanes ; the tachygraphical п, as in mávroc, is very uncommon in ordinary bookhand ; the sign for оу is not generally found on the line; ка! represented by three dots occurs elsewhere in Vat. 1809, Add. mss. 18231, in some Laurentian mss. quoted by Vitelli, pp. 15, 32, and in the late ms. Vat. Pal : 73 discussed by M. Desrousseaux (v. p. 28, n. 1). With regard to the series of Tau-abbreviations, there is to be noticed the freedom with which the dots are superimposed instead (their more usual position), of being arranged one on either side of a stroke of the sign for the following syllable ;
40 ABBREVIATIONS IN GREEK MANUSCRIPTS.
the тоу of this ms. compared with the same syllable in Vat. 1982 will illustrate the difference. It is obviously a mere convenience of the scribe's, and not a distinct usage. A somewhat erroneous idea of the origin of these two dots is given by Gardthausen Griech. Paläogr. p. 199.
In conclusion it is convenient to notice here some mss. which offer one or two tachygraphical signs only. One such is a ms. of Galen, H. 45 in the Capitular Library of S. Peter's at Rome, of the хі-хі century, written on palimpsest vellum ; the text offers no peculiarities, but at the end is written in red the sentence тоб филоббфоџ коро? филагдвом, in the manner represented in the plate. Not only the rov, but the plain strokes for the alpha in a ms. of this age, and the purely tachygraphical form of the o, are very noticeable. A single tachygraphical form, бас, is given in the word ézowsac (the context is ñc kal tov maida éga@woac) by Vallicell. E. 55 of the xith century. Other mss. of this sort that have already been described are Clarke 12 (v. s. uév, те), Angelica T. т. 8 (ro, rec, rov, тос), Roe 16 (ev), Laud. gr. I (тну), Neapol. II. A a. 22 (re, rox).
