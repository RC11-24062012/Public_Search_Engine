To his wife Mrs. Bridget Elwes £2000, over and above her jointure already settled on her—she to be executrix—his honoured uncle Sir John Elwes of Grove House, Fulham, Knt., to be trustee—to said Sir John and his wife the Lady Elizabeth Elwes mourning—unto his wife’s mother, Mrs. Bridgett Dade, mourning—unto his loving sister Mrs. Catherine Soames and her husband, Mr. Henry Soames of Bishopsgate Street, London, and unto his loving sister Mrs. Mary Paget and her husband, Dr. Paget, mourning—all his estate, etc., situate and being at Pans Hanger in the parish of St. Andrew in the co. of Hertford, and all his real and personal estate whatsoever after debts, etc., are paid, to his deare and only son John Elwes and his heirs for ever, etc.
The above estate at Pans-Hanger was no doubt sold by his son, when he came of age, to the Right Hon. William Cowper, afterwards 2nd Earl Cowper.
Jeremy Elwes became possessed of the estate by his marriage, on 16 Sept. 1693, with Mrs. Elizabeth Hitchcock of St. Leonard’s, Shoreditch, spinster, then aged about 20. He himself is described as of St, Margaret’s, Lothbury, London, aged about 21, a bachelor.

Elizabeth Hitchcock’s father acquired the estate of Panshanger by his marriage with Mary, dau. and coheiress of. ... Slaney, and by purchasing her sister’s and coheir’s moiety of the manor.
It may be presumed from his will that Jeremy Elwes was twice married, and that his son John was by his first wife.

Cozoxez WiLLrAM WILLOUGHBY.—A Colonel William Willoughby is mentioned in 1644 as part owner of a ship called the “ Merchant Adventure ” (6th Rept. of the Hist. MSS. Com., p. 32). In 1642 he acted with the Countess Dowager of Rutland in exhibiting à bill in Chancery against the Earl of Rutland (5th Rept. Lords’ Journal, iv., 674). He had some business connection with Lord Willoughby of Parham. Who was this Colonel William Willoughby ? Had he a wife Eliza- beth ? Can he be identified with Colonel William Willoughby who was an active soldier under Cromwell in a regiment known as the “ Regiment of Auxiliaries of the Hamlets of the Tower,” taking command of it in 1644, and who was Commissioner of the Royal Navy from 16 Feb. 1648-9 till his death 30 March 1651? He was then 63 years of age, and must have been born about 1588. This Colonel William Willoughby is known to have been part owner, in 1687, of a ship called “The Discovery.” Any information about Colonel William Willoughby or Mrs. Elizabeth Willoughby, wife of the Commissioner of the Navy, will be thankfully received by Mrs. Edward Elbridge Salisbury, New Haven, Connecticut, U.$.

The Pedigree is about three-quarters of a yard wide, and 44 yards long, com- posed of several skins glued together. It commences with Adam de Stokke, 1312 ; and the last date is 1661, soon after which it appears to have been drawn out; the last name is Thomas, son of Captain Thomas Stokes. The arms are well blazoned in colours, amounting to over sixty coats; and where those of any family were not ascertained blanks are left. Much collateral information is given, and contemporary pedigrees of families into which the Stokes family married, par- ticularly those of Snell and Gore. Towards the close is an escutcheon of six quarters, and on the skin, above this, is a drawing of a lion rampant ermine double queued, holding a tilting-spear, thereon a pennon ; at the head of the pedigree is a lion holding the shield of Stokes. There are several extracts from deeds, etc., and the whole is well executed and in good preservation (1854). At the close of the pedigree of Snell is a date “now living, 1701.”

GENEALOGICAL MEMORANDA RELATING TO THE HUGUENOT FAMILY OF DE VANTIER.
The de Vantiers—as the name was originally spelled, but gradually became Anglicised into de Wantier, Wantié, and finally into Wanty—were a French Protestant family, who fled to this country previous to the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes,
probably soon after the massacre of St. Bartholomew, and in 1659 they are found settled at Thorney Abbey, Cambridgeshire. A French Prayer-book, carefully treasured and handed down, has inscribed on the fly-leaf in faded but distinct handwriting as follows : | “ Le livre des Prières com’unes de Abraham de Vantier, 1696, May y’ 20t* maintenant le livre de Jacob Wantié, Thorney. Henry Wanty, Sutterton, his book 1787.”
This Prayer-book contains, also in MS. à special prayer to be used during the time of persecution, written in antiquated French.
In 1753 (June 26) a deed was executed at a Special Court Baron of the Manor of Fitzwalter in the parish of Fleet, Lincolnshire, conveying to Benjamin Wanty à small estate in an outlying district of this parish, and within four miles of Thorney Abbey. This estate is still held by a descendant, and this deed, which contains important genealogical details, is still in existence. In the Baptismal Register of the French Refugees at Thorney Abbey the name de Vantier occurs only once. The orthography is in every other instance either de Wantier, Vantié, Wantie, or Wanty.
The following records have been collected from various sources, viz., the Baptismal Register Books of Thorney Abbey, the Title-deed of the estate in the parish of Fleet, the Register Books of the parishes of Sutterton, Brothertoft, and Swineshead, and from some registers contained in an old Family Bible (dated 1751) now in the possession of Mrs. Henry Wanty of Lynn.
By the will of Henry Wanty, proved Sep. 12th, 1876, subject to certain con- tingencies, the landed property comes to the descendants of Major Flintham Peet of Holbeach, who now represents this family.

* It is proposed to introduce in the ‘ Miscellanea Genealogica et Heraldica * several Pedigrees, belonging to the Visitation of Dorset taken in 1623, from an old MS. which formerly belonged to Browne Willis, afterwards to Mr. Coombs of Dorchester, to Dr. Colby, and to the Rev. C. W. Bingham, and, after Mr. Bingham’s death, was presented by his widow to the Museum at Dorchester. These pedigrees do not occur in Harl. MS. 1166, which consists of all the now existing original pedigrees (with the signatures attached) entered at that Visitation, and which was printed by the Harleian Society in 1885. The additions to the pedigrees printed in italics, as well as the valuable series of Will Abstracts, have been communicated by Rev. F. Brown, F.S.A., of Beckenham.

SIR RICHARD FRy, KNT.—Can any one inform me who he was? Collins’s ‘ Peerage” and other authorities say that Joan, one of the daughters of Edmund Beaufort, Duke of Somerset, married first Lord Howth of Ireland, and second Sir Richard Fry, Knt.- Lord Howth died about 1500, and I have enquired of the present Earl, but he says his pedigree only shews his own family’s descent,
: Ï am anxious to discover if this Sir Richard Fry was connected, and how, with the Devonshire family of the same name whose ancestor John Fry is also stated to have married Joan Beaufort.
I have in my possession à panel portrait of a person in robes, said by the inscription to be “Sir Thomas Fry, Attourney General to Queen Elizabeth,” and painted by Hans Holbein. I am assured, however, that there never was a Knight or an Attorney General of the name of Fry. Might he not have been Attorney General of Ireland, or of some extinct court such as the Court of Wards ?
.: Any information regarding either Sir Richard Fry, Knt., or Sir. Thomas Fry, will be appreciated.

TUCHER AND SCHEURL.
We present our readers this month with facsimiles of armorial bookplates, variously treated by Durer and Cranach, which, whether regarded as associated with those giants of early heraldic design or as being the first known instances of book- plates at all, are of unusual interest. The original of that by Lucas Cranach is affixed to the 1506 edition of the ‘De Bello Gottorum”’ of Procopius which was purchased for Mr. Tucker, Somerset Herald, many years since by Mr. Quaritch, and was exhibited with Mr. Tucker’s collection at the Heraldic Exhibition at Berlin in 1882. It represents the daughter of Baron Tucher of Simmelsdorff, who was wife of the celebrated Doctor Christopher Scheurl and the mother of his two sons. She holds the achievements of Scheurl and Tucher, and the confusing superscription obviously refers to the dual armorials inherited by the sons. The larger design by Albrecht Durer—the original of which was purchased by Mr. Tucker at Messrs. Sotherby's—is much more elaborate in detail, and for the portrait is substituted a typical female figure with long flowing hair. Much of the working in this is exactly traceable in other drawings of Durer.

The Tuchers of Simmelsdorff, one of the patrician families of Nuremberg, trace their descent from the earliest period of Bavarian history, and its memorials were printed in folio at Schwabach in 1764. The present representative, Baron Tucher of Nuremberg, possesses à pedigree extending to some 200 folio pages of vellum in the highest style of German Heraldry and illuminated art. It was compiled for his ancestor some 200 years since, and is replete with the most exquisite miniature portraits, landscapes, and monumental effigies, in addition to elaborate decoration of the pedigree record, and the border of each leaf is of distinct design and matchless execution. The family appear through several generations to have been great patrons of art, and the collection of their portraits at Simmelsdorff includes, amongst nn ue of great interest, well-preserved works by Holbein, Durer, and

Josiah Palmer, glover, Julius Palmer, glover, Worcester. Enrolled 4 Worcester. Enrolled 4 Barnstaple, Devonshire. July 1809. July 1809. Enrolled 5 Aug. 1830.
The name of Palmer is at a very early date associated with Bridgnorth. Hamo le Palmer and Roger Fitzwilliam are third on the list of Prætors in Eyton's valuable work, ‘ The Antiquities of Shropshire, ‘and in a note the author says, “ The family of Palmer was at this period the wealthiest in the borough.” Hamo le Palmer afterwards appears twice as a Prætor of Bridg- north, and the name of William le Palmer comes twice afterwards as a Provost, the last time in 1265. In the reign of Edward II. Edmund le Palmer and Robert le Palmer occasionally fill the office of Provosts of Bridgnorth. Edmund le Palmer was also a Burgess of Parliament in the same reign, and Robert le Palmer was also elected in the years 1311, 1313, 1321, and 1322. Some interesting particulars are also mentioned of various members of this opulent family, and Eyton gives an elaborate pedigree from Robert le Palmer, inter 1176 and 1206, down to Alice Palmer, whose name occurs in 1342.
The next Palmer who appears at a later date as connected with Bridgnorth is the Rev. Francis Palmer, Rector of Sandy in Bedfordshire, who, by his will dated 1680 and proved 1681, left a sum of money to build and endow a hospital for ten poor widows, and, as it is quaintly expressed on the time-worn tablet over the crumbling stone gateway, ‘“ who had an affection to the Place, his mother being buried in the Church, and was sister to Colonel Billingsley, late of Abbotts Astley, slain in this churchyard in the service of Charles the 1st.”” This Colonel Francis Billingsley was killed on the 31st March 1646, when Cromwell’s forces attacked the town. The Colonel’s sword, a long cavalier’s rapier, is now an interesting memorial on the wall of the south aisle of St. Leonard's Church, having been presented in 1885 to the parish by Mr. Joseph Instone, a descendant from a maternal ancestress of the Billingsley family. Of the family of the Rev. Francis Palmer nothing can yet be ascertained, not even the Christian names of his father and mother.
With regard to the Palmers whose pedigree is traced from the Freemen’s Roll, and who have continued the Christian name of Julius through each generation from the first ancestor of whom. we find any record, it is not unlikely that an ancestor was so named after Julius Palmer, who, in the ‘ Fasti Oxoniensis,’ p. 71, vol. i., is said to have been elected probationer Fellow of Magdalen College 25 July 1549, and a true and perpetual Fellow in the year following. In 1553 he is stated to have left his fellowship, and for more particulars of his life we are referred to ‘ The Acts and Monuments of the Church,’ by John Fox. We there find a long account of him, headed ‘The history and martyrdom of a learned and virtuous young man called Julius Palmer some- time fellow of Magdalene College, Oxford, with two other Martyrs, to wit, John Gwin and Thomas Askin, burned together in Newbury at a place called the Sandpits.” After describing his wanderings and danger resulting from his religious opinions, we are told of his interview with his mother, who, much exasperated that he had so far forgotten his worldly advantage as to leave his fellowship, and to come to her in Berkshire for assistance, says she believed in the doctrine taught in King Edward’s time, which was not heresy, but truth, and in no chosen words cursed him from her door. Yet it states, relenting slightly, as he left she hurled an old angel after him, saying, “ Take that to keep thee a true man.” His last examination, when he was taken as a heretic, was in the church of the borough town of Newbury in Berkshire, on the river | Kennet, twenty-six miles from Oxford, with nearly 6000 population, a place noted in the time of “ Henery the 8th for its serges and shaloons, and its wealthy manufacturer, John Winchcombe, familiarly called Jack of Newbury.” On the 16 of July 1556 Julius Palmer and his two com-

«
panions were brought into the church and examined before Dr. J effrey for the Bishop of Sarum, Sir Richard Abridges, Knight and High Sheriff of the Shire, Sir William Rainsford, Knight, Master John Winchcomb, Esquire, and the Parson of Englefñeld. The interrogatories by Dr. Jeffrey and the answers of Julius Palmer are of considerable length. The High Sheriff and Master Winchcomb were evidently reluctant to condemn him, and tried to induce him to retract. Indeed, Jack of Newbury, as Master Winchcomb was called, was evidently a benevolent man, and said to Julius, “ Take pity on thy golden years and pleasant flowers of thy lusty youth before it is too late.” Julius Palmer, however, remained firm to his opinions, and the next day, 17 July 1556, in the reign of Queen Mary, the three were burnt at Newbury before the High Sheriff and others in authority. We cannot connect the Palmers of Bridgnorth by any ties of consanguinity to Julius Palmer who came to such a sad ending, but it is very probable that the Christian name of Julius was adopted in remembrance of his martyrdom. It would be interesting to know if Julius is continued by the descendants of the family, if still at Worcester or Barnstaple, since 1830, when the last Julius Palmer was enrolled a freeman of Bridgnorth,

TUCHER AND SCHEURL BOOKPLATES. (See ante, pp. 104-5.)
Accompanying the Armorial Bookplate in the volume of Procopius referred to, is a woodcut, ascribed to Cranach, which, as coloured by some idler, is here repro- duced in facsimile. It is an instance of the curious yet frequent conceit of the introduction of the portraits of patrons and others in sacred subjects and incidents. In this we have Scheurl, in his robe as Doctor of Laws, kneeling at the foot of the cross of Christ, and with him his sons George, born 1532, and Christopher, born 1535. The sons are represented as boys of at least ten years, and appear to be in some scholastic dress. This would date the woodcut very late as the work of Lucas Cranach the elder, and is without also his constant mark of the dragon in his later works; nor is it in his style ; the difference in the drawing and accompani- ments of the Scheurl crest is also to be noticed. The woodcut is more probably the work of his son. It is surrounded with eight quotations from the Psalms, and one from the Book of Tobit ; and at foot is noted the date [1481] of Doctor Scheurl’s. birth, and that of his sons, as above.

GRANT OF SUPPORTERS TO SIR EDWARD HERBERT, Kr.*
The grant of supporters was made by William Segar, Garter, in 1624 to Sir Edward Herbert, Knight, on his creation as Baron of Castle Island in the Irish Peerage shortly after his recall as Ambassador to France. It will be noticed that the supporters are charged, the dexter with “ English roses ” and the sinister  Galliæ liliüis,” as permanent symbols of the success of his mission. Sir Edward Herbert was afterwards raised to the English Pecrage by his well-known title of Lord Herbert of Chirbury. The grant is in the possession of the Earl of Powis, who is the representative of that branch of the Herbert family, as well as of three other distinct lines of Herbert.
Quarterings : 1, Herbert; 2, Milo; 3, New March; 4, St. Mark ox Broad Spear ; 5, vor of Gwent; 6, Morley ; 7, Cradock ; 8, Gamm.

RoBINsON Famizy.—The undersigned will be glad of any information relating to the ancestry of Rowland Robinson, born in 1654 in Long Burgh, six miles from Carlisle, co. Cumberland. In 1675 he came to America, and settled in the colony of Rhode Island. His children were John, Joseph, Elizabeth, Margaret, Sarah, Rowland, Mercy, William, Mary, Rowland again, Sarah again, and Ruth. Perhaps the somewhat unusual name of Rowland may lead to his identification. The following coat of arms has been used by the Robinsons in America for several generations : Vert, on a chevron between three bucks trippant or, as many cinque- foils gules.

“ At the N.E, end of the churchyard at Fulham in Middlesex, and at an almost equal distance between the chancel and wall of the churchyard, is a large and handsome altar tomb of Portland stone, covered with a slab of black marble, on the top of which are the arms of the See of London, viz., 2 swords en saltier, hilts downwards, impaling 3 herons close (sie) for Gibson ; ensigned by a mitre, and under them this inscription :
# Edmundus Gibson, D.D. Londinensis Episcopus, obiit 6 Sept. 1748 Ætat. 79.
“ At the east front of the tomb are these arms: viz.: Gibson, and on an escocheon of pre- tence à lion rampant within a bordure, being the arms of his wife : these on an atchievement in the middle of the isle of the church, where they are thus blasoned, Azure, 8 storks argent, for Gibson ; on an escocheon of pretence, Or, a lion rampant within a border azure, for [Jones], and this motto, Memoria Pii aeterna. In the same middle isle are the arms of Bp. Gibson impaled by the See of London, viz., Gules, 2 swords en saltier argent, pomels or, ensigned by a mitre and a key and crosier behind the shield ; with the above said motto of Memoria Pii aeterna at the bottom of the atchievement.
‘“ Bp. Gibson was one of the worthiest Bps. of my time, as well as one of the most learned. He was educated in Queen's College in Oxon, where he had a brother who was Provost of the College, whose wife was à sister of my father’s friend and landlord, Edward Alexander of Baberham in the county of Cambridge, Esq. The Bp. had several sons, two of whom I remember at Eton Schole, and one died while he was a student in Clare Hall, Cambridge, and lies buried in St. Edward’s Church there. One thing ought particularly to be mentioned to the honour of Bp. Gibson, who, when he had a legacy left him by Dr. Crowe, who had been preferred by him, of between 3 and 4000 pds., generously gave it among that Doctor’s poor relations. One of the Bps. dauters was married to D' Christopher Wilson, formerly Fellow of St, Catherine’s Hall in Cambridge, and now Prebendary of Westminster and St. Paul’s, and Rector of Halstead in Essex.”’—Cole’s MS. 5831, fo. 43, British Museum.

27 Feb. 1728. Administration of the goods of Constance Heane of Ruardeane granted to Henry Heane her son.
* I have failed to identify “James Heane, a prisoner in the King’s Bench.” He was, I suppose, either James Heane, the second son of Major-General James Heane, or his nephew James, the son of Thomas Heane of Tockington.
James Heane, to whom his father left £1, appears to have lived in his youth with his mother’s relatives at Abenhall or Micheldeane. In 1702 administration of the goods of his grandfather, William Cross of Abenhall, was granted to him. He was engaged in iron making.

GRANT OF ARMS TO WILLIAM FISHER OF LONDON, MERCHANT, 1660.
To all and singular unto whom these presents shall come Sir Edward Walker Knight Garter Principall King of Armes of Englishmen sendeth Greeting. Itis most agreeable to justice and reason that such persons as have well deserved of their Prince and Countrey and have lived virtuously and in good fame and reputation should have particular markes and rewardes to distinguish them from vulgar and inferior people. Amongst which the bearing of Armes hath for many Ages been held in highest honour and esteem, the which have been distributed

accords to the worthynes of the Person to whom such Armes have been assigned as proper markes of honour whilest they lfve and as fitt Inducements to stur up Posterity to equalize and exceede their Anncestors from whom they derive the same in all Noblenes and Virtue. And whereas I am fully satisfied that William Fisher of the Citty of London merchant (sonne of William Fisher of Litleover in the County of Derby, where that Family hath lived in reputation and esteeme) hath upon all occasions in the late unhappy times of distraction expressed his zeale and dutifull affection to the just Interest of the Crowne and his Mat most happy restauration whereby he may justly meritt some particular testimony to evidence the same to posterity. Know yee therefore that I the said Sir Edward Walker Knight Garter Principall King of Armes by the power and authority annexed unto my office of Carter and confirmed unto me by Letters patent under the great Seale of England, Have given granted and assigned and doe by these presents give grant and assigne unto the said W" Fisher the Coat of Armes and Creast hereafter mentioned vizt, Azure a Fesse imbatled counterbatled betweene three Dolphins (naïant) or.

In Witness whereof I have hereunto subscribi my Name and affixed the Seale of my Office this tenth day of November in the twelfth year of the Reign of our Sovereign Lord Charles the Second by the Grace of God King of England, France, and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, &c.

This George Evelyn was, I presume, the first of his family settled at Worthy (see ‘ Mis. Gen. et Her. Vol. I., New Series, p. 186). He probably also built the old mansion (now superseded) in Worthy Park.
“ Æsop,” in his ‘Sporting Reminiscences of Hampshire, states that the first gentleman having a pack of hounds in Hants was a Mr. Evelyn, who hunted this district about 1745. He is said to have had his kennels at “Harmsworth ” (? Armsworth, a tything of Old Alresford), and also others at his seat near Wrotham in Kent.

FAMILIES OF DAMME, WOODCOCK, BLAKE, AND DADE.
On 30th July 1750 James Woodcock of the parish of St. Andrew, Holborn, co. Middx., and Margaret Damm, or Damme, of the same parish, were married by licence at St. Martin’s in the Fields, co. Middx. The affidavit states that both were of full age. I am anxious to obtain information as to the parentage and ancestry of both of the above. Margaret Woodcock survived her husband, and was remarried, at St. George the Martyr, Queen’s Square, Middx., on 20 December 1755, to the Rev. Thomas Maddock, Rector of Liverpool. In some MS. notes her second husband has recorded that Margaret Damme was born at West Derby, co. Lanc., in June 1720, and that her first husband was ‘James Woodcock, Esq., who, as a Merchant, had made a very good fortune in the Island of Jamaica, originally coming from Yorkshire in Great Britain.” He also mentions that “James Woodcock, senior, Merchant, departed this life on the 18 of April in the year 1754, and in the 64 of his age, and was interred in the Parish Church of St. Andrew’s, Holborn (in London), on 28th following.” By Margaret his wife, James Woodcock had a son James who, according to his stepfather’s notes, was born at French-Hey, co. Glouc., 16 July (0.8.) 1751, and who, in 1792, took, by Royal Licence, the name and arms of Croft, having married in 1778 Charlotte Elizabeth, eldest da. and coheir of
240 MISCELLANEA GENEALOGICA ET HERALDICA.
Sir Archer Croft of Croft Castle, co. Hereford, Bart., by whom he was ancestor of the family of Croft of Greenham, Berks.
On the 5th May 1764 “Rokeby Scott of parish of St. Andrew’s, Plymouth, Lieutenant in ye 68th Company of Marines,” was married at Landrake, co. Cornwall, by licence, to “ Grace Dade, widow.” She was widow of John Dade, Esq., and daughter of Richard Blake of Trelogan alias Treluggan, co. Cornwall, Esq., to whom she is also stated to have been coheir. In the Registers of St. Erney’s, which adjoins Landrake, is the baptism of “Grace da. of M' R1 Blake and Eliz. his wife privately May 22, Rect publick baptism July 15, 1739,” and the same Registers record the marriage of “M' Richard Blake and Ms Elizabeth Blake,” 28 Sept. 1782, and the burials of “Richard Blake of Trelogan, Esq',” 3 Jan. 1770, “ Elizabeth Blake, widow,” 2 June 1772, and “Mary Dade Dr of Grace Scott,” 25 April 1767; also the baptisms of “Phillip,” “ Eliz.,” and “ Rich,” children of ‘ M" Rd Blake and Eliz. his wife.”
Trelogan, or Treluggan, is in the parish of Landrake, but near the church of St. Erney’s parish. In the latter church is a hatchment on which is the date 1770 and the arms of Blake, viz.: Argent, a chevron between three garbs Sable, impaling “Azure, à saltire Argent between four martlets (or birds of some sort) Or ;”? Crest, “ On a chapeau Or a martlet Argent.” Local tradition assigns this hatch- ment to the memory of Mr. Richard Blake of Trelogan, and as the date on it is that of the year of his burial there seems no reason to doubt it. Can any corre- spondent identify the arms impaled with Blake? If Elizabeth Blake, whom Mr. Richard Blake married, as above, in 1732, was his only wife, this coat must be intended for hers, and in that case she must, though his namesake, have been of a totally different family of Blake. Burke’s ‘ Armory ? gives no coat like it to Blake.
To anyone who can give me any information about the family of Blake of Trelogan, or identify the “John Dade, Esq.,” who married Miss Grace Blake, as her first husband, I shall be very grateful. 1 may add that Lysons, in his ‘ History of Cornwall, states that “ Dogherty inherits Trelogan from Blake, his wife having been Blake heiress.” Family tradition in her descendants makes Grace Blake a coheir to her father. The following are the Licence for and Certificate of the Marriage of James Woodcock and Margaret Damm :
Extracted from the Principal Registry of the Archiepiscopal See of Canterbury.
VICAR-GENERAL’S OFFICE. 30th July 1750. Which day appeared personally James Woodcock of the Parish of Saint Andrew, Holborn, in the County of Middlesex, aged upwards of twenty-one years, a Bachelor, and alledged that he intends to intermarry with Margaret Damm of the same Parish, aged upwards of twenty-one years, a Spinster, not knowing or believing any impediment by reason of any precontract, consanguinity, affinity, or any other lawful means whatsoever to hinder the said intended Marriage, of the truth of which he made Oath and prayed Licence for them to be married in the Parish Church of Saint Martin in the Fields in the County of Middlesex.

250 MISCELLANEA GENEALOGICA ET HERALDICA.
The exact position of above grantee in the pedigree is as follows: Owen ap Griffith of Lilunllo married twice ; his second wife was Grwenwhyfar, dau. and coh. of Thomas Ireland ; by her, with other issue, he had Richard Owen admitted a Burgess of Shrewsbury 21 Feb. 1520, and died 1575. This Richard, by his first wife, Mary, dau. and coh. of Thomas Ottley [settlement before their marriage dated 9 Oct. 1540], left, with other issue, his eldest son Thomas Owen, Justice of Common Pleas, who built Condover, and died in 1598, leaving sons, namely, Sir Roger Owen and Sir William Owen, who both succeeded to Condover; and from Sir William descend in the female line the present holders of CONDOvER. The second son of Richard was Richard Owen of WuxiTELEY and Shrewsbury, who died 25 Oct. 1594, and from whom descend in the male line the present Owens [now Kynaston] of HARDWICK.
Owen ap Griffith married as his first wife Isabel, dau. of David Lloyd ap Jevan ap Ririd Midleton, and left by her two sons; the eldest Howel ap David, called also Howel Owen, had his share of the Machynlleth estates, and left a son Richard Owen of Shrewsbury, who, by Alicia his wife, dau. of David Ireland, left a son Edward Owen, the grantee, in 1582. He lived in great style in a mansion called the ‘ Bellstone ” in Shrewsbury, which he had built for himself, and married Joan, dau. of Richard Purcell of Dinthill. His son Robert Owen appears as of Wood- house, and was High Sheriff of Salop 1618. He had a son Edward, who had a son Robert, who had a son John, all successively of Woodhouse. At this point the estate became vested in two heiresses, Muriel and Sarah Owen, the only children of John ; these ladies rearranged the entail, which passed through their aunt, their father’s sister, Martha Owen, who married Humphrey Kynaston of Bryngwyn, and left an only child Mary Kynaston, who married Wm. Mostyn, by whom she left a son Wm. Mostyn of Bryngwyn, who, by his wife Grace, dau. of Robert Wynn of Plasnewydd, left a son Wm. Mostyn, also of Bryngwyn, who assumed the name of Owen when the Woodhouse property lapsed to him under the entail. Mr. Wm. Mostyn- Owen of Woodhouse and Bryngwyn was M.P. for co. Montgomery ; he left a son Wm. Mostyn-Owen of Woodhouse, the father of the present Mr. Arthur Mostyn- Owen, now, 1887, of WooDHOUSE, who thus represents in the female line the eldest branch of the Owens of Llunllo.
We have now to return to the second son of Owen ap Griffith by his first wife, viz., David Lloyd ap Owen, who married Thomasine, 2nd dau. and coh. of Thomas Ireland ; from this marriage descend in the direct male line the present Owens of BETTWS, and in the female line the Owens of TEDSMORE.
We thus see that the ancient family of Owen, descended from Howel Dha, exists in the in line only in the Owens of Bettws and the Owens [now Kynaston] of Hardwick.
NoTE ON OWEN HERAILDRY.—The Visitation 1623 states that the abovenamed Richard Owen of Shrewsbury, who died 1575, son of Owen ap Griffith ap Mado, used for his arms: Quarterly, 1 and 4, Argent, a lion rampant sable [the arms of his direct male ancestor Jevan ap Jevan Voel Frych of Kaereinion] ; 2 and 8, Argent, a cross florée engrailed sable between four Cornish choughs proper, on a chief azure a boar’s head fessways and couped argent [the arms of his direct male ancestor Idnerth Benvras] ; and in the earlier Visitations, 1564 and 1584, and in many early Welsh records, these arms, either or both of them quarterly, are recorded as borne from ancient times. Cooke, in the above grant of a Crest, 1582, declares them ; and yet, as all heralds about that time seem to have done, he proceeded to disfigure the simple ancient heraldry by adding a difference! A very slight acquaintance with such confirmations or exemplifications will shew that this was the almost universal custom. Heralds at that date scarcely ever allowed a blazon to pass under review without surcharging in some way. Ormerod (‘Hist. of Cheshire,’ ïi., 126) thus speaks of it: “In 1663, Dugdale allowed to this branch the arms of Holford, differenced by à canton only, which, as is well known, he substituted for the usual mark of legitimate cadency.” And s0 each succeeding
MISCELLANEA GENEALOGICA ET HERALDICA. 251
herald, having examined and proved the right to the ancient and simple arms, proceeded to add other charges as his “tiék ”’<“ examined and found correct.” At the end of the sixteenth century overloaded heraldry seems to have been even preferred. The above grant declares the ancient simple coat, and limits the canton and crest to the descendants of grantee’s father ; but how do we find it in fact?  Except the line of David Lloyd ap Owen, the 2nd son of Owen ap Griffith by his first wife, whose descendants for several generations used the arms of Idnerth Benvras alone, all the branches at once adopted the canton and the eagle’s head as à crest.
Judge Owen’s monument in Westminster Abbey, erected immediately after his death in 1598 by Sir Roger, his son, shews the canton. This 1582 grantee was one of the executors under Judge Owen’s will, and must have known the limitations of his own grant ; it seems strange he should have allowed this alteration from the simple ancient arms as borne by Judge Owen’s father, who died 1575.
The brotlier of Judge Owen, Richard Owen of Whiteley, also used the canton, and his grandson, William Owen, who greatly rebuilt the old mansion at Whiteley, introduced a carved stone doorway, shewing the lion and canton with the date 1667. The same canton appears in the arms of Robert, another brother of Judge Owen, who died 17 March 1603, in his benefactions to St. Alkmund’s We can only suppose that at that time such superadded charges were looked on as honourable augmentations.
When writing this note I have before me correspondence, 1804 to 1810, which, after mentioning the searches made by Bigland, Clarencieux, at the College of Heralds, seems to suggest that perhaps a further grant extended the canton to the Condover family. I would remark this is extremely improbable, as it would have been irregular, and moreover Bigland would have found it duiy recorded. There is at the College of Heralds an elaborated pedigree of this family drawn up by Sir Wm. Dugdale, the heraldry in which is no doubt exactly followed in the pedigree at Tedsmore, drawn in 1851 by Wm. Courthope, Rouge Croix Poursuivant, and beautifully illuminated with the bearings used by each generation. There is also ab nee a parchment pedigree drawn by John Caine about 1618, and similarly treated.
The above-mentioned correspondence, 1810, speaks of the “old Crest as borne by the Llunilo family,” viz., a Cornish chough proper, holding in the claw a fleur- de-lys argent. Cooke, 1582, declares he had found no crest; but perhaps he meant none duly entered in the College of Heralds.
Several Mottoes are given in Burke’s ‘ Landed Gentry” and other books. Harl. MS. 1396 says that Richard Owen, named above, who died in 1575, used ‘ Vive ut vivas.”
“Vermis et ego,” on Judge Owen’s monument at Westminster, is a moral apothegm rather than a motto. He was à very eminent man, revered by his Queen and his country ; he was in the zenith of prosperity and popularity, and had barely completed his mansion at Condover in 1598, when Death, with impartial foot, entered in. Such is worldly greatness ! |

WALDO NOTES.
In the Bishop of London’s Registry a licence was issued on Oct. 22, 1701, for the marriage at St. Matthew, Friday Street, of Joseph Waldo of St. Botolph, Aldersgate, Bachelor, 21, and Jane Bradgate, of St. Martin’s in Fields, Spr., 28. (Harleian Society’s Publications, vol. xxvi., p. 327.) The age here given of the above Joseph identifies him with the ‘Joseph, son of Timothy Waldoow, mercer by trade,” who was baptized at All Hallows, Bread Street, Feb, 3, 1680 (‘ Mis. Gen. et Her. N.$., vol. ïi., p. 102), whose sister Grace was also baptized there previously on July 15, 1677.
At p. 12 of ‘Notes respecting the Family of Waldo, by M. C. Jones, among the issue of Timothy Waldo of Clerkenwell is given, “3, Timothy (or Jesse) Waldo, an officer, married Elizabeth, daughter of Proudcoat of Pealling, co. Leicester, and had issue two sons,” by whom the above are apparently meant. A further elucidation is contained in the will of Elizabeth Bradgate of St. Paul’s, Covent Garden, spinster, executed July 24, 1718. The executrix makes bequests (inter alios) to her father, William Bradgate, Esq. ; to her sister Jane, wife of Joseph Waldo, whom she makes sole executrix; to her brother-in-law Joseph Waldo; and to her cousin Daniel Waldo. Administration of the will was granted in the P.C.C. Feb. 3, 1728, to William Bradgate, the brother, Jane Waldo having renounced.
The Bradgate family was long settled at Little Peatling, Leicestershire, William Bradgate, the father of the testatrix being then the head of it. The above may be worth recording as filling up part of a blank in the Waldo pedigree, of which the portion in question is subjoined.

The Earl of Same, Suffolk was charged with issuing £6000 unprofitably to Sir Roger: Dallison, but the King’s loss therein was compensated by the Earls fine; notwithstanding which, Sir Roger Dallison was prosecuted for that sum, and Sir Thomas Monson is à great sufferer thereby. His Majesty would do an bonourable deed to give some compensation to Monson. [St. Pap. Dom. Jas. I, November 1st, 1624.]

“Sir Thomas Dallison, a Lancashire gentleman, of great service in Prince Rupert’s Brigade, whose loyalty cost him his life at Nazeby, and £12,000 in his estate, being one of those noble persons, whose too much courage (as Buchanan saith in all defeats of the Scots) was the reason they were conquered, and their pursuing their enemies too far was the reason of their being beaten by them.”
“There were in the King's army three Colonels more of the name, viz, Sir Charles, Sir Robert, and Sir William who spent £130,000 therein ; men of great command in their country, bringing the strength thereof to the reasonable assistance of the King.” [Lloyd’s Memories.]

. The following Pedigree of Lovell of Skelton is from an old MS. in the possession of Mrs. Palmer, daughter and heiress of the late Rev.

Arms of Lovell of Skelton from the Visitation of Yorkshire in 1666.
On a seal appended to a deed of Thomas Lovell of Skelton, dated from that place 11 K. Richard IT., are these arms : On a chevron, between three foxes’ heads erased, as many cinquefoils. Inscription: Sigill. Thomæ Lovell. (Vide Visitation of Yorkshire in 1666.)
* The Visitation calls her Bridget, daughter of William Pennington of Muncaster, but the addition of the bend, if correct, would point out a younger line. This variation of the armsis not noticed by Burke or Papworth. He had issue—1, William, died young ; 2, Thomas, above ; 3, George ; 4, William, ob. s.p.; 5, Robert of York, who married Katherine, daughter of William Aske of York, and had William, Henry, Anne, and Bridgett ; 6, Henry, who married a daughter of .... Johnson of Newmarket Heath, and had Nehemias and Margaret ; 7, Roger, who married, and had Arthur, Ralph, a third son, and a daughter ; and 7, John. Also four daughters—Ann, Elizabeth, Jane, and Grace.
f She was Joan, daughter of William Hungate of Saxton by his wife Audrey, daughter of John Saltmarsh of Saltmarsh. The chevron is Argent, not Ermine, in the Visitation. They had Thomas, above, Isabel, Philippa, and Audrey, who married John Hansley of Easthorpe, near Malton. Possibly they may have been parents of George Lovell, who married at Skelton 3 Aug. 1615 Susan Cammist or Chammist, and of Mr. John Lovell, buried at St. Olave, York, 20 June 1626, and children were baptised there, viz.,, Mary in 1616, Edward in 1617, Thomas in 1618, George in 1620, William in 1623, and John in 1624, Of these, George was the George Lovell who had a child baptized Mary at Skelton 1 Nov.1646. John was buried at St. Olave’s 27 June 1626, and William buried at the same place in Nov. 1626.
ÿ She was Mary, daughter of Christopher Herbert of York, J.P., by his wife Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas Hemsworth of Hemsworth and Purston, near Pontefract.

DUGDALE. (Vide p. 128.)
According to the ‘Visitation of London, 1633-4,/ Harl. Soc., Christopher Dugdale, described as of Polesholt, co. Wilts, was the third son of John Dugdale of Clitherow, co. Lanc., Gent., anno 2 Eliz. He had as eldest brother Henry Dugdale of Codford, co. Wilts ; his wife was Bridget, da. of Fuller, by whom he had, besides his second son Thomas of Seend, co. Wilts, an eldest son Christopher, à third son Robert, a clothworker of London, anno 1634, who married Alice, da. of John Snelston of Foxbanck, co. Chester, leaving issue; this Robert signs the Visitation. The arms and crest are those of Dugdale, a mullet on a crescent for difference. James Dugdale is generally given as the grandfather of Sir William Dugdale, Garter, who is stated on the Seend monument to be Christopher’s “ex fratre nepos.” Can this expression be construed cousin ?

MISCELLANEA GENEALOGICA ET HERALDICA. 287
MADDOCK PEDIGREE. (Vide Second Series, vol. 1., p. 36.)
I am anxious to correct a statement, at the above reference, that John Maddock, Esq., Mayor of Chester in 1676, was son and heir of Randal Maddock of Edge, gent. and great-grandson of Randal Maddock j.u. of Edge, gent.—a statement also erroneously made at page 364 of vol. iv., New Series. This descent rested on family tradition of long continuance, and was apparently borne out by original information ; but the recent discovery of two MS. pedigrees by Randal Holme the second and third, of Chester, which were not previously known to me, and which are fully confirmed by wills, registers, etc., shew that John Maddock, the Mayor of Chester, had been confused with his distant cousin and contemporary John Maddock of Edge ; and now that his separate identity has been fully established T proceed to give his descent so far as it is known. He was eldest son and heir of John Maddocke of Chester, gent., Freeman of the Tanners’ Company, by his second wife Jane, second dau. of Richard Broster of Chester, gent., and his wife Margery, dau. of Thos. Liyniall of Hordley, gent. (see Vis. of Cheshire, Coll. of Arms, C. 38, fo. 72; Harl. MS. 2155, fo. 55°; Harl. MS. 2168, fo. 75 ; and ‘ Cheshire and Lancashire Funeral Certificates, pub. 1882). John Maddocke and Jane Broster were mar. at St. John's, Chester, 5 June 1609, and their eldest son, John (the Mayor), was bap. there 21 March 1612. The said John Maddocke, husband of Jane Broster, was son of John Maddocks of Chester, and some time of Farndon, co. Chester, gent., by Ellen his wife. He made his will 1 April 1634, and died 28 Feb. 1638-9, his will being proved at Chester 21 Aug. 1639. By his second wife Margaret, sister of Hugh Leigh of Chester, Alderman, he had four sons and a daughter (see ‘Cheshire and Lancashire Funeral Certificates ”). His father, John Maddocks of Farndon and Chester, gent. (who had a brother Thomas, of Crewe in the parish of Farndon, who by his will, dated 4 April 1607, appointed his nephew John Maddocke of Chester his Ex’or), made his will 4 April 1605, which was proved at Chester 14 Sept. of the same year. By this will he left his lands in Flintshire and Denbigh- shire to be sold. He was buried in St. Bridget’s, Chester, 2 June 1605. Randal Holme begins his pedigree with him, and merely states that he was “ descended from Maddocks of Crewe Greene.” He gives the pedigree side by side with that of the Maddocks of Edge, who were descended from Robert Madocks of Crewe in Farndon, who was a son of John Madocks of Crewe in Farndon and Holt, co. Denbigh, the first of his race to settle at Crewe and Holt, and to take à surname, temp. Henry VIT. and he attributes the same coat of arms to both.
How then was this John Maddocks of Farndon and Chester descended from John Madocks alias ap Madock, of Crewe and Holt? This is the point on which I want information. Î can only conjecture that he may have been a son of a certain Thomas Maddock of Farndon, who recovered lands in the township of Clutton, Manor of Farndon, in 37 Hen. VIIL. (4.p. 1546 ; see PI. Ro.), and that this Thomas may have been a son of John Madocks or ap Madock, and a brother of Robert Madocks, ancestor of the Edge branch of the family. If Randal Holme’s statement that John Maddocks was ‘“descended from the Maddocks of Crewe Greene ” is correct, he must have come from John Madocks alias ap Madock, as that individual was the first of the family to settle in Crewe and Holt, he being son of Madoc ap David of Iscoyd, co. Flint, and brother of Richard Madocks of Agdon, ancestor of the Agdon line (see Harl. MS. 2146, fo. 119), and of Griffith ap Madoc, ancestor of the family of Griffith of Chester (see Harl. MS. 2146, fo. 22°). To any- one who could give me any information on this point, or who could explain Randal Holmes reference to “Welsh b. 564” at the head of the Maddock pedigree given by him at fo. 22e of Harl. MS. 2146, I should be most grateful.
I have also six additions to make to the little pedigree of the marriages and descendants of John Maddock, Mayor of Chester in 1676:—(1) His second wife Frances Starkey was bap. at Great Budworth, co. Chester, 20 Dec. 1603. (2) A notice of his first wife Elizabeth Williams, and the blazon of her arms, are given by R. Holme at fo. 94 of Harl. M$. 2146. (3) The wife of his eldest son John Maddock (conjectured wrongly by me to have been Brilliana Trafford) is stated by
288 MISCELLANEA GENEALOGICA ET HERALDICA.
R. Holme to have been Alice, sister to the celebrated Puritan divine the Rev. Peter Legh, Rector of St. John’s, Chester, 1658-1662, and daughter of Richard Legh of Northwood in High Legh, co. Chester, descended from a younger branch of Legh of High Legh (see Harl. M$. 2187, fo. 77, and 2146, fo. 74). (4) His son Thomas’s will was proved at Chester 5 July 1722, being dated 10 Jan. 1718-19. (5) The marriage of Benjamin Maddock with Miss Sarah Hodson took place at St. Michael’s, Chester, 25 Dec. 1684. (6) Their son Samuel was bap. at St. Michael’s, Chester, 12 May 1689.

GRANT OF ARMS TO STEPHEN THORNLEY OF LONDON, 1655.
To all and singular to whom these presents shall come Edward Bysshe Esq. Garter Principall King of Armes of Englishmen sendeth Greeting. Whereas antiently it hath been a custome and to this Day continued to all Estates and degrees of men have been and are distinguished each from other by sundry markes and signes commonly called armes being no otherwise then outward demonstrations and re- membrances of inward worth of the bearers atcheived either by their valour in the feild in time of Warr ; or by their virtuous endeavours in the Commonwealth in time of Peace, to the end that it might the more stirre up and incite them & others to virtuous Atcheivments. And whereas Stephen Thornley Cittyzen and Goldsmith of London descended from the family of the Thornleys of Ecleston in Cheshire, a person well deserving hath requested me to assign unto him such Armes as hee & his Posterity may lawfully bear Know yee therefore that I the said Garter having seriously considered the Premisses do by these presents by the virtue of my said office grant & appoint unto the said Stephen Thornley & his Heires shall bear for his Arms Gules two barres gemelles Argent with a Canton Ermyn: And for his Crest upon a Wreathe of his Collours a Wolfe’s head couped ermyne and collered with two Barrulets gules, mantled gules doubled Argent as in the Margent hereof is depicted. Which Armes and Crest before expressed I the said Garter by the said Authority annexed to my office as also by Letters Patents of my said office und' the Great Seal of England do by these presents declare assigne give grant & confirm to the said Stephen Thornly and his heires to be by them and every of them borne with their due differences according to the Law of Armes for ever. In witness whereof I have hereunto subscribed my name and put to the Seal of my Office this eight day of December in the yeare of our Lord God one Thousand six hundred fifty and five.
BOOKPLATE AND SEAL OF BARTLETT OF MARLDON, ST. MARY CHURCH, ETC. CO. DEVON.*
Mr. Wyon in engraving this bookplate has followed the exemplification by Sir Albert Woods, Garter, as follows :
“The above armorial bearings, viz., Arms, Quarterly argent and gules, five lozenges conjoined in fesse between four crescents all counterchanged. Crest, On a mount vert a moor-cock sable, combed and wattled gules, in the beak an ear of wheat leaved and slipped proper, resting the dexter claw on a crescent gules. Motto,

MISCELLANEA GENEALOGICA ET HERALDICA. 295
Deo favente cresco. Do of right belong and appertain to the descendants of John Adams Bartlett of Liverpool in the County Palatine of Lancaster, Esquire, deceased. ‘ College of Arms, London, (S2) ALBERT W. Woops,
20 July 1880. Garter.”
It seems when application was made for an exact and correct drawing of the arms and crest as they had been used by this family since the end of the seventeenth century, and probably much earlier, it was explained that the College of Heralds contained no satisfactory records, and therefore that a fresh grant must be taken, unless descent proved from a grantee.
The late Mr. John Adams Bartlett was the son of John Bartlett of Teignmouth, co. Devon, and grandson of Thomas Bartlett of Marldon in the same county. The Nicholas Adams Bartlett of Marldon mentioned in Polwhele’s ‘ Devonshire,’ vol. ïi., p. 490, was the eldest son of this Mr. Thomas Bartlett of Marldon by his second wife Christian, dau. and heiress of Captain Adams, R.N. [by his wife Agnes Drew, one of the Drews of Sharpham, see Prince’s ‘ Worthies of Devon,’ pp. 334-5]; and by this marriage further lands in Marldon Parish and a house called Mudge’s Place descended to Mr. N. A. Bartlett.
The family have been for many generations the principal landowners in the neighbouring parish of St. Mary Church ; they were, in fact, the only large owners in that parish. John Bartlett occurs 1475, but their holdings there extended to the earliest times, although the fixed surname would not be settled before the first half of the fourteenth century (see two papers on St. Mary Church Parish by Canon Brownlow, Devonshire Association for the Advancement of Science, Literature, etc., 1886).
The plain and simple arms continuously borne by them—Quarterly per fess indented argent and gules, four crescents counterchanged—are preserved on old family plate. A teapot, with the Hall-mark 1787, bears these arms, and the pheasant crest with the cypher J. E. B., that is John and Elizabeth Bartlett : these. were the father and mother of Mr. John Adams Bartlett ; they were married in ea 1785, and she was the daughter of Mr. Jacob Bartlett, mentioned by Canon
rownlow.
The annexed woodcuts shew a silver seal preserved in the family, and the same arms are given for Bartlett of Marldon and of Exeter in a “Catalogue of the Arms of the Nobility and Gentry of Devonshire, etc., anno 1689,” a MS. preserved in the Cornwall Street Library, Plymouth, and written only a few years before the date of . the engraving of this seal.
Mr. John Adams Bartlett died in 1855, leaving three sons, (1) John Adams, (2) William, and (3) Thomas. Mr. Wm. Bartlett, the second son, whose bookplate is now given, is of Highfeld House, Knotty Ash, near Liverpool. He married in 1865 Mary, the second daughter of James Johnson of Liverpool, and has issue three sons, (1) John Adams Bartlett of Ch. Ch. Coll., Oxford; (2) Wm. Francis; (8) Godfrey Thomas ; and six daughters.
Premising that the Bartletts of Marldon and St. Mary Church Parish, co. Devon, have used the simple old arms certainly for over 200 years, and that the Bartletts of Castle Morton, co. Worcester, returned at the Visitation 1569 these arms and a pedigree of six descents, thus taking their line back to about 1420-30 [we pass over
296 MISCELLANEA GENEALOGICA ET HERALDICA.
the branch settled at Senbury, co. Gloucester, their descent being shewn from the Castle Morton family], we have now to point out that these arms, Quarterly per fess indented, four crescents, are not really Bartlett arms, but the bearings of Stopham of Stopham, co. Sussex, which were adopted by the Barttelots after the marriage with the heiress which brought to them the Stopham estates. William Stopham of Stopham in Sussex is recorded as bearing in 1350, Argent, a bend sable ; but about 1395, which seems to be the date of this marriage, the Stopham family were using the four crescents’ coat. John Barttelot of Sussex, circa 1400, bore— Sable, three gauntlets argent ; and when Segar Garter confirmed to the Barttelots of Stopham their arms, and granted their swan crest, 27 Oct. 1616, he put these gauntlets in the first quarter, and the crescent coat for Stopham in the second, with other quarterings. [Compare for these statements Berry’s ‘Sussex Pedigrees,’ p.178 ; ‘Mis. Gen. et Her. Quarterly Series, vol.i., pp. 106-7; Guillim’s ‘ Display,” 1724 ed., pp. 34, 420 ; Sussex Archæological Society, vol. xxvii.]
No clear connection is shewn between this family of Barttelot and the Castle Morton family. In the pedigree at Stopham a Thomas Barttelot, 3rd son of John Barrttelot of Stopham, which John died 20 Nov. 1493, is stated to be the ancestor of the Barttelots of Gloucestershire; but the earlier tracing of the pedigree in Worcestershire, as noted from the Visitation of 1569, precludes that possibility. If from a common ancestor, the Castle Morton family would have to deduce from a Barttelot nearly 100 years earlier in date.
And as regards the Marldon family no connection is probable ; for there is no doubt, from Canon Brownlow’s data, that they held lands from the earliest times in that district, and long before they had any fixed surname! The surname “ Bartlet,”” being a diminutive of Bartholomew, could not originate earlier than towards the end of the fourteenth century, and such à name would lead to just what we find, viz., many families in different districts bearing the same name, but in no way connected; they having arisen from $0o many separate individual ancestors who happened at that date to bear the name of Bartholomew. The Barttelots of Stopham must have acquired their surname from some other source, as Walter Barttelot and Adam Barttelot are mentioned in Subsidy Rolls s0 early as 1295.
We are therefore driven to the conclusion that the Sussex family at Stopham continued to put forward and use the four crescent.coat as the arms of Barttelot from about 1400, until more exact examination shewed, perhaps when Sir Wm. Segar made his searches in 1616, that the original arms of the Sussex Barttelots were gauntlets. In this interval other families had adopted the crescents as the arms of Bartlett, and heralds had acknowledged those arms to some families of that name by the prescriptive right of long usage—a plea not now admitted.

It is interesting to note that in a recent grant to the name of Ashmead-Bartlett - the College of Heralds has combined the gauntlets and crescents in one coat,.

SEAL OF JOHN DALYSON OF HACKTHORN, CO. LINCOLN.
The Seal from which the above engraving is taken is appended to Harleian Charter 45, B. 26, British Museum (wide p. 154), and the legend runs thus : “ $ Ioh’ Dalycvn D’ Hactorn.”
Owing to the imperfect state of the Seal appended to Harleian Charter 45, B. 24, it has been impossible to have a satisfactory engraving made, but the legend runs : “+ 5’ Clemencie [ De N'Jevile.”?

Prayers to be said for the souls of myself, Jon de S’c'o Laud’, late my husband, of John de S’e’o Laudo, my late husband's father, and of Ela, his wife, my late husband’s mother.
B'ors : Robert Vele, Richard Virgo, Richard Bonvyll, and John Bury.
Oxerseer : William, Lord Botreaux, my son-in-larw. (There must be an error here—William, Lord Botreaux, who married her daughter Elizabeth St. Lo, died 25 May 1395 ; therefore, either the Overseer of the will was her grandson, or the will was made before 1395. There is internal evidence that the will was made before her son-in-law’s death in May 1395, also before 1397, as John Bonvyl! (step)son of Alice Bonvyll died in Oct. 1396, and Richard Bonvyll died before 1397.)

The jury found that Sir Peter held, in right of Margaret his wife, who mas still surviving. the following manors, etc., Mayden Newton, and messuages in la Thorpe, Natton, and Crokeway, Dorset; Penyton, a moiety of Bedham, Flexlond, and Benstede, co.

The assertions of Beltz in his ‘ Memorials of the Order of the Garter,’ and of Cleaveland in his ‘ Genealogical History of the Family of Courtenay,’ folio, 1735, that Sir Peter Courtenay, K.G., died unmarried are thus proved to be erroneous.

ARMS.—Argent, three martlets gules, on a chief engrailed of the second three annulets or ; impaling (IRONSIDE), Per pale gules and azure, a cross patonce or.
LOVELL ARMS. (Vide p. 261.)
The arms as given on the above page are on the authority of the Visitation of Yorkshire, 1666, in the College of Arms (being a facsimile of the tricking there), where the heads are called “ foxes ?” in the margin. But from the very old pedigree given pp. 259-261 the heads are beyond question “wolves.” On a sketch of the seal of Thomas Lôvell, dated from Skelton 11 K. Richard II., in the Harleian Collection, they are drawn as wolves’ heads, as they are also on two old seals of the family, one of silver not later than about 1680, the other of the early part of the eighteenth century. In the ‘ Visitation of Yorkshire, by Flower, in 1563-64, edited by the Rev.C. B. Norcliffe for the Harleian Society, the heads are given as those of wolves, and in the MS. by Sir William Fairfax, of Yorkshire Arms, and in the “Visitation of Yorkshire,’ both printed by Joseph Foster, they also are “foxes.” The copy of the Visitation of 1666 in Harl. MSS. gives the arms as a chevron between three wolves’ heads erased ; Crest, a talbot courant argent. Gwillim, Edmondson, Burke, and Papworth also support the long use by the family of wolves’ heads, which usage is naturally strengthened by the family name. Each match in the old MS. above referred to has the arms ncatly drawn, Lovell impaling the arms of the wife. ARTHUR J. JEWERS.

1 Gledholt, a residence near Huddersfeld, occupied for several centuries.
? The Brookes of Newhouse near Huddersfield were à respectable family of minor gentry. They bore, Argent, on a bend sable a hawk’s Lure ; with the motto, ‘ En Dieu ma foy.” There is no pedigree of the family in the Heralds’ Visitations, but there is one given by Mr. Hunter (Add. MSS. 24458, fol. 313) which is fairly correct. There is another of the Dodworth Branch in ‘South Yorkshire, vol. ü., p. 262. John Charles Brooke, Somerset Herald, was a member of the Dodworth Branch.
8 Hugh Gledhill, Vicar of Huddersfield, was licensed to be married in 1567 (Paver’s Marriage Licences, ‘ Yorkshire Archæological Journal, vol. vii., p. 289) ; his wife’s name is not given. His will was proved at York in 1581.
# Greenhead, for a long time the principal house in Huddersfield, occupied originally by a family of Hirsts, who were ruined in the Civil Wars, afterwards by the Wilkinsons, Fentons, Sir John Kay, Bart., and the Allens. The old part of the house still remains encased in a modern front ; it contains several wainscoted rooms, and two very fine carved-oak mantelpieces.
5 Golcar, originally Guthlacscar, a manor still belonging to the Saviles.
6 Katherine, daughter of William Ramsden of Longley and Rosamund Pilkington of Nether Bradley, was married at Huddersfeld, on the 30th October 1621, to Richard Holland of Heaton, co. Lancaster.
7 William Blyth was of the family of that name of Norton, co. Derby, and Barnby Don, co. Ebor. There is a pedigree of the family in Harl. MSS$. 4630, fol. 48. Arms: Ermine, three roebucks proper. William Blyth married Elizabeth, daughter and coheïr of Thomas Stapleton, a cadet of the Stapletons of Carlton. There was another sister married to Edmund Eltofts. The estate of Quarmby was divided between these ladies.
8 Thomas Pilkington of Nether Bradley in the parish of Huddersfield was Bowbearer to Queen Elizabeth. He was son of Robert Pilkington descended from an illegitimate son of Sir John Pilkington. Thomas married Barbara Reresby of Thribergh, and is the ancestor of Sir Lionel Pilkington of Chevet, Bart.
$ John Blyth’s will is dated 2 Nov. 1586 ; he desires to be buried at Huddersfeld, near his son. His wife Elizabeth, who died the following year, was a Savile of Newhall near Elland. Her will is dated 1588, and she desires to be buried at Huddersfield, near her husband, and £10 to be spent on a monument for herself and husband.
10 Robert Ramsden was admitted to the Rectory of Spofforth 9 May 1573, to the Arch- deaconry of York 7 December 1575, and to the Vicarage of Huddersfeld 5 June 1581,

The Lisitation of Cssexr, 1664—1668. Epitep BY J. J. HOWARD, LL.D., F.S.A.
À copy, by JOHN WARBURTON, Somerset Herald, of the “ Visitation of Essex”’ made by Sir EDWARD BYSSHE, Clarenceux, between the years 1664 and 1668, was purchased at the sale of the Collections of the late Mr. TUCKER, Somerset Herald. As this appears to be the only Transcript extant, it is thought desirable to print a few numbered and signed copies.
The Subscription Price has been fixed at One Guinea, and Subscribers’ Names should be forwarded to the EDITOR, care of Messrs. MITCHELL and HUGHES, 140 Wardour Street, London.
LE
To be Published by Subscription, price 15s. bound in cloth, similar in size to Colonel Chester’s ‘Marriage Licences of London,’ published by the Harleian Society.
Lincoln Marriage Licences, 1598—1628. EpiTEep By A. GIBBONS, OF LINCOLN.
These Licences have hitherto been practically inaccessible, the only Documents connected with them known to be preserved in the Bishop's Registry being bundles of Marriage Bonds without Calendars or Indexes of any kind.
In the course, however, of the arrangement of the Bishop’s Records by Mr. GIBBONS of Lincoln, the Editor of the present Work, various volumes and portions of volumes of the original Allegation Books have come to light, and an Abstract of these for the years above mentioned (with the exception of a break between 1606 and 1612, for which period the books have not been found) has been prepared, and a few signed and numbered copies are now offered for subscription.
The Abstract is a complete one, and not a mere selection, comprising practically all the in- formation contained in the Allegations—that is, as a rule, the Date, Names, and Descriptions of the Contracting Parties, their Parents and Sureties, the Applicant, and the place where the Marriage is to be solemnized,
The Volume is estimated to contain about 6000 entries.

Advenda to the Bisitation of Dorsetsbire, 1628:
TOGETHER WITH A COLLECTION OF DORSETSHIRE PEDIGREES FROM A MANUSCRIPT IN THE DORCHESTER MUSEUM.
EDITED BY
THE REV. FREDERIC T. COLBY, D.D. F.S.A, AND
JOHN PAUL RYLANDS, F.S.A.
EXTRACT FROM PREFACE.
In the year 1885 the Harleian Society issued the Visitation of the County of Dorset taken in the year 1623, edited by Mr. RYLANDS. This volume is a transcript of Harl. MS. 1166. In examining an old manuscript volume of Dorsetshire pedigrees, now preserved in the Museum at Dorchester, Dr. CoLBY observed that it contained several pedigrees which apparently belong to the Visitation of 1623, but which do not occur in Harl. MS. 1166, and it was considered advisable that they should be printed as Addenda to the Harleian Society's volume.
The Dorchester manuscript also contains à few pedigrees of early date, a number of the pedigrees which were entered at the Visitation of 1565 (though not in every case identical in their details with the pedigrees then recorded), and several pedigrees which are dated respec- tively 1625, 1626, 1627, 1628, 1630, and 16381, and which were, perhaps, entered in the College of Arms in those years. It is anticipated that the Editors, by including these pedigrees in this collection, have made an acceptable addition to printed Dorsetshire genealogy.
The ADDENDA was in the first instance contributed to Wiscellanea Genealogica et Heraldica, and is now reprinted as a necessary Supplement to the ‘ Visitation of Dorset, 1623.’

UXith an Huminateë Plate of ing Henry CI. By WALTER C. METCALFE, F.S.A.
Aboüt ten years since a Book of Knights from Henry VII. to James I. was announced as one of the Harleian Society’s Publications, Sir John Maclean being the proposed Editor. That Publication was abandoned by the Society before the present Work was commenced. This fact - is stated in order to counteract any impression which may exist that the Society's contemplated Book will ever be issued,
“ Mr, Metcalfe’s principle with regard to the publication of ancient MSS., and one which has our cordial support, is not to delay their ‘production for a lifetime, by the accumulation of genealogical and other notes, the extent of which no one could foresee,’ but to give students the benefit of a printed text as promptly as possible. The numerous Visitations that have been published under his editorship, many of which have first appeared in our pages, would have been indefinitely delayed had any other course been adopted. In the present instance, whilst every endeavour has been made to render the work complete and accurate, nothing in the way of copious unnotation has been attempted. Neither was this necessary. The authorities—the Cottonian, Harleian, and Lansdowne MSS.; Halls Chronicle; Stow's London; Nicolas’'s Orders of Knighthood ; Philipot and Walkley and others —duly cited at the commencement of the list, will enable the reader readily to judge how far further proof is required. We are delighted to see that the arms given in the Cottonian MS. Claudius C. 3 are now made thoroughly available, This alone should entitle Mr. Metcalfe to the heraldic student’s sincere gratitude. As a frontispiece, we have a chromo-lithograph of King Henry VI.—the first knight appearing in the book—from Harl. MS. 4205, who was dubbed a knight at Leicester on Whit-Sunday, A.D. 1426, by the Duke of Bedford, who came over to England : after the battell of Vernoill in Perche” A full Index completes this handsome and valuable volume.”"— Genealogist, Oct. 1885.

OR THE
HOUSE OF NEVILL IN SUNSHINE AND SHADE. By HENRY J. SWALLOW.
‘ This book, according to the Preface, is an ‘attempt to produce a record of the Nevill family which may be of interest both to the antiquary and the general reader,” That the Author has succeeded in his attempt a cursory glance at the volume will convince the reader. ”— Antiquarian Magazine, August, 1885.
# Inasmuch as no other continuous account of the family exists, we feel sure that the reading public, especially those who take an interest in genealogy, will gladly welcome Mr. Swallow’s Work. Itis marked by very wide reading and research, and compiled in a very graceful and agreeable manner, ”— Vide Review by Sir John Maclean in Transactions of the Bristol and Gloucestershire Archæological Society, vol. ix., part. i.
“ The Author has devoted a very considerable amount of research to his subject, and the Work throughout evinces painstaking care to gather up all that may be gleaned from ancient chronicles and State papers respecting a house whose members were famed, almost without exception, for military prowess and ability, or for political importance, throughout the mediæval history of England. Richard Nevill, the Kingmaker, his fortunes and his fate; the beautiful and unhappy Lady Anne Nevill; Raby Castle, its noble architecture and its noble owners ; Sheriff Hutton Castle ; Bamborough Castle, scene of many a stubborn conflict ; and Middleham Castle, majestic in decay,—all furnish eloquent themes, and the Author has not been slow to put on record the interesting aspects under which they are to.be studied -by the archæologist who is desirous of knowing the history of one of England’s noblest lineages, When these stories are told in the attractive manner in which Mr. Swallow has told them, they acquire a greater hold on our memory, and, possess a deeper fascination over our feelings.”—Journal of the British Archæological Association, vol. xli., part ii.
“The Work béars on every page the evidence of very great care, and the results of scholarly inquiry, The narrative is as complete as it is ever likely to be made,”—Nemcastle Courant.

The volume is ver handsomely got up. It is a quarto of 144 pages, and is enriched with an index of AT nE It ought to figure in every Irish-gentleman’s Hibrary.”— Dublin Evening Mail. :

ENGLISH CATHOLICS,
LS FROM THE. BREACH WITH ROME, IN 1534, TO THE PRESENT TIME. | By JOSEPH GILLOW.
The object of this Work is to present, in the most ready and convenient form, a concise category of the Literary efforts, educational struggles, and religions snfferings of the fnglish Catholics from the Breach with Rome, in 1534, to the present time.
It is almost needless to add that the antiquary and genealogist will find much that will repay perusal. Almost every Catholic family will be represented, and the Author’s well-known partiality for antiquarian and genealogical pursuits will, he trusts, be accepted as sufficient guarantee that every endeavour will be made to elucidate family history of which the circum- scribed character of -the Work will admit. :

By A. W. CORNELIUS HALLEN, M.A. F.S.A. (Scor.), F. Hu. Soc.
The entries number about 4000, and are of more than local interest,  Muthill, during.the eighteenth century, was the only Episcopal Church in a very large district, and most of the Perthshire gentry were Episcopalians ; very many of the Highland farmers and cottars also remained Members of this Church long after its disestablishment in 1688.
It is only possible to give a few well-known names : Drummond, Erskine, Forbes, Graham, Johnstone, McGregor, Murray, Oliphant, and Rollo. : F ;
The Ecclesiologist will find some interesting entries connected with the sufferings of the Episcopal Church in Scotland in the eïghteenth century. The Dunning baptism case is entered with an explanatory note (original).
The. Muthill Registers are the only known Church Registers in the Scottish Episcopal Church of such great age,

“ Mr. Hill has laid all those who value accurate knowledge of the past under a deep debt of obligation. The parish register of which he is the legal custodian scems to have been well kept and “carefully preserved, and he has edited it in à manner which, for all practical purposes, renders access to the original needless, Not content with this, which must have been a serious labour, he has added a series of notes which will convey much new knowledge to most persons as to the laws relating to marriage. ...... The Thorington registers bear testimony to the fact that double Christian names have been uncommon until quite recent times.

By WALTER C. METCALFE, FS.A.
About ten years since a Book of Knights from Henry VII. to James I. was announced as one of the Harleian Society’s Publications, Sir John Maclean being the proposed Editor. That Publication was abandoned by the Society before the present Work was commenced. This fact is stated in order to counteract any impression which may exist that the Society’s contemplated Book will ever be issued,
“ Mr. Metcalfe’s principle with regard to the publication of ancient MSS., and one which has our cordial support, is not to delay their ‘production for a lifetime, by the accumulation of genealogical and other notes, the extent of which no one could foresee,’ but to give students the benefit of a printed text as promptly as possible. The numerous Visitations that have been published under his editorship, many of which have first appeared in our pages, would have been indefinitely delayed had any other course been adopted. In the present instance, whilst every endeavour has been made to render the work complete and accurate, nothing in the way of copious annotation has been attempted. Neither was this necessary. The authorities—the Cottonian, Harleian, and Lansdowne MSS.; Halls Chronicle; Stow's London; Nicolas’s Orders of Knighthood ; Philipot and Walkley and others—duly cited at the commencement of the list, will enable the reader readily to judge how far further proof is required. We are delighted to see that the arms given in the Cottonian MS. Claudius C.3 are now made thoroughly available, This alone should entitle Mr. Metcalfe to the heraldic student's sincere gratitude, As a frontispiece, we haye a chromo-lithograph of King Henry VI.—the first knight appearing in the book—from Harl. MS. 4205, who was dubbed a knight at Leicester on Whit-Sunday, A.D. 1426. by the Duke of Bedford, who came over to England ‘after the battell of Vernoill in Perche. À full Index completes this handsome and valuable volume.”"—Genealogist, Oct, 1885.

THE FIRST PART OF À NEW AND ENLARGED EDITION OF
Hastev’s History of the County of Kent,
BEING A HISTORY OF
Tbe Bundred of Blackbeatb,
The most important Division of the County, comprising the Kentish Suburbs of London, and forming a complete Work in itself.
So long ago as the year 1836, the late Reverend Thomas Streatfeild, of Charts Edge, issued a Circular announcing his intention of pubhsiog a History of Kent, to the accumulation of materials for which he, for nearly halfa century, devoted the energies of his life. Mr. Streatfeild secured the co-operation in his task of his friend the late Reverend Lambert B, Larking, Vicar of Ryarsh, who was himself a well-known collector of information connected with the County of Kent, The two friends pursued, with untiring energy, the task they had undertaken, and their joint investigations resulted in the acquisition of a vast amount of information which they fondly hoped to embody in their History, and submit to the public. The death, however, of Mr. Streatfeild in 1848, and of Mr. Larking in 1868,
revented the realisation of their hopes, and at the latter date their collections fell into the hands of Mr. John Wingñeld Larking, of The Firs, Lee, who determined to PR the memory of his brother, and of his friend Mr. Streatfeild, by utilising the materials which they ha géné together, and giving to the County of Kent the result of their labours. Several years, however, elapsed before he succeeded in finding a competent Editor for the contemplated Work. Fortunately, he eventually obtained the services of Dr, Henry Ho Drake, who undertook the onerous duty; and after a lengthened period, and the expenditure of editorial labour which can only be appreciated by the initiated, Mr, Larking is able to present to the gentlemen of Kent the History of the Blackheath Hundred of the County as a Work complete in itself, but designed to constitute a part of the History of the entire County.
Dr. Drake is willing to undertake, if sufficient encouragement is forthcoming to justify it, the further prosecution of the History of Kent on a scheme similar to.that on which the History of the Hundred of Blackheath is based, viz., upon the text of ‘“ Hasted,”” revised, recast, and enlarged, with information acquired by Messrs. Streatfeild and Larking, and with additional Notes by the Editor in verification and elucidation of the statements made.
As much of the groundwork for the History of Kent has been already covered by the Editor while collecting materials among the Public Records for the First Part, future Parts could be issued annually. The Editor alludes to this in the ‘‘ Introductory Notes.”

Bastev’s DBistorp of the Countp of Kent,
BEING A HISTORY OF
The Bundred of Blackbeath,
The most important Division of the County, comprising the Kentish Suburbs of London, and forming a complete Work in itself.
So long ago as the year 1836, the late Reverend Thomas Streatfeild, of Charts Edge, issued a Cireular announcing his intention of publishing a History of Kent, to the accumulation of materials for which he, for nearly halfa century, devoted the energies of Fi life. Mr. Streatfeild secured the co-operation in his task of his friend the late Reverend Lambert B, Larking, Vicar of Ryarsh, who was himself a well-known collector of information connected with the County of Kent. The two friends pursued, with untiring energy, the task they had undertaken, and their joint investigations resulted in the acquisition of a vast amount of information which they fondly hoped to embody in their History, and submit to the public. The death, however, of Mr. Streatfeild in 1848, and of Mr. Larking in 1868,
revented the realisation of their hopes, and at the latter date their collections fell into the hands of Mr. John Wingfeld Larking, of The Firs, Lee, who determined to PAS the memory of his brother, and of his friend Mr. Streatfeild, by utilising the materials which they had gathered together, and giving to the County of Kent the result of their labours. Several years, however, elapsed before he succeeded in finding a competent Editor for the contemplated Work. Fortunately, he eventually obtained the services of Dr. Henry Holman Drake, who undertook the onerous duty; and after a lengthened period, and the expenditure of editorial labour which can only be appreciated by the initiated, Mr. Larking is able to present to the gentlemen of Kent the History of the Blackheath Hundred of the County as à Work complete in itself, but designed to constitute à part of the History of the entire County.
Dr. Drake is willing to undertake, if sufficient encouragement is forthcoming to justify it, the further prosecution of the History of Kent on a scheme similar to that on which the History of the Hundred of Blackheath is based, viz., upon the text of “ Hasted,”” revised, recast, and enlarged, with information acquired by Messrs.

THE FIRST PART Of A NEW AND ENLARGED EDITION OF
Hastev’s History of the Countp of Kent,
BEING A HISTORY OF
Che Hundred of Blackbeath,
The most important Division of the County, comprising the Kentish Suburbs of London, and forming a complete Work in itself.
So long ago as the year 1836, the late Reverend Thomas Streatfeild, of Charts Edge, issued a Circular announcing his intention of publishing à History of Kent, to the accumulation of materials for which he, for nearly halfa century, devoted the energies of his life. - Mr. Streatfeild secured the co-operation in his task of his friend the late Reverend Lambert B. Larking, Vicar of Ryarsh, who was himself a well-known collector of information connected with the County of Kent, The two friends pursued, with untiring energy, the task they had undertaken, and their joint investigations resulted in the acquisition of a vast amount of information which they fondly hoped to embody in their History, and submit to the publie. The death, however, of Mr. Streatfeild in 1848, and of Mr, Larking in 1868, prevented the realisation of their hopes, and at the latter date their collections fell into the hands of Mr. John Wingfield Larking, of The Firs, Lee, who determined to perpetuate the memory of his brother, and of his friend Mr. Streatfeild, by utilising the materials which they had gathered together, and giving to the County of Kent the result of their labours. Several years, however, elapsed before he succeeded in finding a competent Editor for the contemplated Work. Fortunately, he eventually obtained the services of Dr. Henry Holman Drake, who undertook the onerous duty; and after a lengthened period, and the expenditure of editorial labour which can only be appreciated by the initiated, Mr. Larking is able to present to the gentlemen of Kent the History of the Blackheath Hundred of the County as a Work complete in itself, but designed to constitute a part of the History of the entire County.
Dr. Drake is willing to undertake, if sufficient encouragement is forthcoming to justify it, the further prosecution of the History of Kent on a scheme similar to that on which the History of the Hundred of Blackheath is based, viz., upon the text of “ Hasted,”? revised, recast, and enlarged, with information acquired by Messrs. Streatfeild and Larking, and with additional Notes by the Editor in verification and elucidation of the statements made.
As much of the groundwork for the History of Kent has been already covered by the Editor while collecting materials among the Public Records for the First Part, future Parts could be issued annually. The Editor alludes to this in the ‘‘ Introductory Notes”?

Hastev’s History of the Countp of Kent,
BEING A HISTORY OF
Che Hundred of Blackbcath,
The most important Division of the County, comprising the Kentish Suburbs of London, and forming a complete Work in itself.
So long ago as the year 1836, the late Reverend Thomas Streatfeild, of Charts Edge, issued a Cireular announcing his intention of publishing à History of Kent, to the accumulation of materials for which he, for nearly halfa century, devoted the energies of his life, Mr. Streatfeild secured the co-operation in his task of his friend the late Reverend Lambert B. Larking, Vicar of Ryarsh, who was himself a well-known collector of information connected with the County of Kent. The two friends pursued, with untiring energy, the task they had undertaken, and their joint investigations resulted in the acquisition of à vast amount of information which they fondly hoped to embody in their History, and submit to the public. The death, however, of Mr. Streatfeild in 1848, and of Mr. Larking in 1868, prevented the realisation of their hopes, and at the latter date their collections fell into the hands of Mr. Jobn Wingfeld Larking, of The Firs, Lee, who determined to perpetuate the memory of his brother, and of his friend Mr. Streatfeild, by utilising the materials which they had gathered together, and giving to the County of Kent the result of their labours. Several years, however, elapsed before he succeeded in finding a competent Editor for the contemplated Work. Fortunately, he eventually obtained the services of Dr. Henry Holmau Drake, who undertook the onerous duty; and after a lengthened period, and the expenditure of editorial labour which can only be appreciated by the initiated, Mr. Larking is able to present to the gentlemen of Kent the History of the Blackheath Hundred of the County as a Work complete in itself, but designed to constitute à part of the History of the entire County.
Dr. Drake is willing to undertake, if sufficient encouragement is forthcoming to justify it, the further prosecution of the History of Kent on a scheme similar to that on which the History of the Hundred of Blackheath is based, viz., upon the text of ‘ Hasted,”’ revised, recast, and enlarged, with information acquired by Messrs. Streatfeild and
Larking, and with additional Notes by the Editor in verification and elucidation of the statements made. S As much of the groundwork for the History of Kent has been already covered by the Editor while collecting materials among the Publie Records for the First Part, future Parts could be issued annually. The Editor alludes to this in the ‘ Introductory Notes.”

The most important Division of the County, comprising the Kentish Suburbs of London, and forming a complete Work in itself.
So long ago as the year 1836, the late Reverend Thomas Streatfeild, of Charts Edge, issued a Cireular announcing his intention of publishing à History of Kent, to the accumulation of materials for which he, for nearly halfa century, devoted the energies of his life. Mr. Streatfeild secured the co-operation in his task of his friend the late Reverend Lambert B, Larking, Vicar of Ryarsh, who was himself a well-known collector of information connected with the County of Kent. The two friends pursued, with untiring energy, the task they had undertaken, and their joint investigations resulted in the acquisition of à vast amount of information which they fondly hoped to embody in their History, and submit to the public. The death, however, of Mr. Streatfeild in 1848, and of Mr. Larking in 1868, prevented the realisation of their hopes, and at the latter date their collections fell into the hands of Mr. John Wingfield Larking, of The Firs, Lee, who determined to perpetuate the memory of his brother, and of his friend Mr. Streatfeild, by utilising the materials which they had gathered together, and giving to the County of Kent the result of their labours. Several years, however, elapsed before he succeeded in finding a competent Editor for the contemplated Work. Fortunately, he eventually obtained the services of Dr. Henry Holman Drake, who undertook the onerous duty; and after à lengthened period, and the expenditure of editorial labour which can only be appreciated by the initiated, Mr. Larking is able to present to the gentlemen of Kent the History of the Blackheath Hundred of the County as a Work complete in itself, but designed to constitute à part of the History of the entire County.
Dr. Drake is willing to undertake, if sufficient encouragement is forthcoming to justify it, the further prosecution of the History of Kent on a scheme similar to that on which the History of the Hundred of Blackheathi is based, viz., upon the text of ‘ Hasted,”” revised, recast, and enlarged, with information acquired by Messrs. Streatfeild and Larking, and with additioual Notes by the Editor in verification and elucidation of the statements made.
As much of the groundwork for the History of Kent has been already covered by the Editor while collecting materials among the Publie Records for the First Part, future Parts could be issued annually. The Editor alludes to this in the ‘‘Introductory Notes.”

The most important Division of the County, comprising the Kentish Suburbs of London, and formèing a complete Work in itself.
Epirep BY HENRY H. DRAKE,
MEMBER OF THE ROYAL ARCHÆOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND.
Dr. Drake is willing to undertake, if suflicient encouragement is forthcoming to justify it, the further prosecution of the History of Kent on a scheme similar to that on which the History of the Hundred of Blackheath is based, viz., upon the text of ‘ Hasted,”” revised, recast, and enlarged, with information acquired by Messrs. Streatfeild and Larking, and with additional Notes by the Editor in verification and elucidation of the statements made.
As much of the groundwork for the History of Kent has been already covered by the Editor while collecting materials among the Public Records for the First Part, future Parts could be issued annually. The Editor alludes te this in the ‘‘ Introductory Notes.”

About ten years since a Book of Knights from Henry VII. to James I. was announced as one of the Harleian Society’s Publications, Sir John Maclean being the proposed Editor. That Publication was abandoned by the Society before the present Work was commenced. This fact is stated in order to counteract any impression which may exist that the Society’s contemplated Book will ever be issued.

The Renisters of tbe Barish Church ot Candsiworth ir tbe County of Surrep,
FROM THE COMMENCEMENT IN 1603 TO 1787.
It is proposed to publish these Registers which, from the proximity of Wandsworth to London, and the fact that they contain numerous entries ‘relative to the Huguenots, both French and Dutch, who settled here, have a more than local interest.
Wandsworth had, moreover, the first Presbyterian Church in England (Neale’s ‘ History of Puritanism ”), and it is tolerably certain that the Register of Burials contains many entries relative to the Puritans, Among the Marriages is one entry of especial interest to Americans, viz., ‘ Richard Yearwood and Katherine Ellettsone on the 28th May 1627.” Mrs. Ellettsone was the "mother of the founder of Harvard University.
They will be edited for the Vicar of the Parish, the Rev. Wm. Reed, M.A., by Mr. J.T. Squire, and will be issued to Subscribers in Four Parts—I. MARRIAGES ; II. BAPTISMS : ; III. BURIALS ; IV. INDEX, TITLE-PAGE, etc., uniform in size with the well- known Harleian Society’s Repisters.
The names of Subscribers should be sent to Mr. J. T. SQUIRE, 33 Birdhurst Road, Wanäsworth, S.W. Only a limited number of copies will be printed, and upon the publication of Part IV. the price will be raised to 25s.
Just published, 384 pages demy 8vo, with Six Plates, price 218.

The Work is embellished with sixty whole-page illustrations of the various signs and of the iron and wooden brackets for their suspension from the houses, all of which are taken from trustworthy sources. A Plan of Old Lombard Street is also given.
*,* As a List of Subscribers will be incorporated with the text of the Work, it is respectfully requested that signatures be carefully written in full.

Eprrep 8y HENRY H. DRAKE,
MEMBER OF THE ROYAL ARCHÆOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND,
Dr. Drake is willing to undertake, if sufficient encouragement is forthcoming to justify it, the further prosecution of the History of Kent on a scheme similar to that on which the History of the Hundred of Blackheath is based, viz., upon the text of “ Hasted,” revised, recast, and enlarged, with information acquired by Messrs. Streatfeild and Lerking, and with additional Notes by the Editor in verification and elucidation of the statements made.
As much of the groundwork for the History of Kent has been already covered by the Editor while collecting materials among the Public Records for the First Part, future Parts could be issued annually. The Editor alludes to this in the ‘‘ Introductory Notes.’

About ten years since a Book of Knights from Henry VII. to James I, was announced as one of the Harleian Societys Publications, Sir John Maclean being the proposed Editor. That Publication was abandoned by the Society before the present Work was commenced. This fact is stated in order to counteract any impression which may exist that the Society’'s contemplated Book will ever be issued.

The Editors, at the request of several friends, have issued these Pedigrees from ‘ The Visitation of Kent in 1663-68’ as à separate Volume. Many of them have appeared previously in the ‘ Miscellanea Genealogica et Heraldica,' but the Annotations have all been amplified, and the data specially authenticated. It is believed that they will prove of assistance t6 County Historians and Genealogists.
No County Visitations have been issued with Annotations similar to those here produced, with the exception of the Norfolk Visitation, edited by Colonel BULWER, printed in the ‘ Norfolk Archæological Society’s Journal, and the Suffolk Visitation, edited by Dr. HoOWwARD, two volumes of which were issued some years ago.

Pediarecs from the Bisitation of Kent, 1663-68.
ANNOTATED BY JOSEPH JACKSON HOWARD, LL.D., AND
ROBERT HOVENDEN.
The Editors, at the request of several friends, have issued these Pedigrees from ‘ The Visitation of Kent in 1663-68’ as a separate Volume. Many of them have appeared previously in the ‘ Miscellanea Genealogica et Heraldica,’ but the Annotations have all been amplified, and the data specially authenticated. It is believed that theyiwill prove of assistance to County Historians and Genealogists.
No County Visitations have been issued with Annotations similar to those here produced, with the exception of the Norfolk Visitation, edited by Colonel BULWER, printed in the ‘ Norfolk Archæological Society’s Journal,’ and the Suffolk Visitation, edited by Dr. HowARD, two volumes of which were issued some years ago.

‘AMERICA HERALDICA!
Under this title is now being published a highly artistical compilation of the Coats of Arms, Crests, and Mottoes taken over from Europe by prominent American families, having emigrated into that country between A.Dp. 1600 and 1800. Ég
It includes twelve full-page Illustrations, 15 x 12 inches, each page containing sixteen Coats of Arms, of equal importance, painted by a Prize Pupil of the Paris National School of Fine Arts, in gold, silver, and colours: one hundred and ninety-two Coats of Arms in all. The Text accompanying these Plates gives (with engraved Crest and Motto) :—1st, the origin in. Europe of each Coat of Arms ; 2nd, the name of the first Ancestor known to have introduced it in America ; 3rd, a short Argument concerning the family connections, if any, between the European and American possessors of said Coat of Arms.
On account of the great success attained by the first four Parts of ‘ America Heraldica,’ issued according to the original circular, the Editor has been induced to add to his first list of over two hundred names the well-authenticated Coats of Arms of about eighty prominent American families.
To furthermore complete this standard Work, the Editor has decided to give, as an Appendix to it :—
1. À General Alphabetical Index, containing, with all needed Additions and Corrections:
A. The Blazoning, or Heraldic description, of all Coats of Arms contained in the Plates, B. An exhaustive list of old American families (not mentioned in the book itself) claiming connection with, and bearing the arms cf, the Titled Nobility of Europe, or Baronets of the British Empire (also with full Heraldic descriptions) —bringing the grand total of armorial devices, painted, engraved, or simply described in ‘ America Heraldica, to over four hundred, and actually doubling the importance of the Work. 2. A short Vocabulary of all Heraldic terms used in the Work, with necessary illustrations. Parts VII. and VIII. to include all the additional information spoken of above, and four Coloured Plates, numbered respectively XIII, XIV. XV., and XVI., are now issued at a supple- mentary cost to Subscribers of £1 1s. for both Parts.
* .* No Parts or Plates will be sold separately, at any price, either now or hereafter.

MEMOIRS OF THOMAS PAPILLON,
OF LONDON, MERCHANT, 1623-1702.
By MAJOR PAPILLON, A LINEAL DESCENDANT.
Principally compiled from Autograph Manuscripts. With Portraits of Thomas Papillon and his Wife, and others.
The lot of THOMAS PAPILLON was cast in troublous times, extending from the closing years of James I. to the first of that of Anne’s reign. He was of an ancient French family, which warmly embraced the Reformed religion, and took much interest in its promotion. His great- grandfather fell in the Massacre of St. Bartholomew in 1572. His father and two aunts were brought to England in their childhood (1588), though his grandfather and uncles remained in France. He began public life at the age of thirteen as apprentice to a London merchant of French origin, with whom he was connected, and a year later he was entered as apprentice to the Worshipful the Mercers Company. He lived through the Plague, escaped the Fire, and purchased a property in East Kent. Soon afterwards he became M.P. for Dover, in the Country-party interest ; but while opposing the Government, he was ever loyal to the Crown. After four years of self-banishment, he returned with joy to his native land, soon after the accession of William III. He was forthwith re-elected M.P. for Dover ; and a seat as Alderman of the City of London was warmly pressed upon him, but without effect. War was declared against France, and before long the King persuaded him to undertake the office of First Commissioner for Victualling the Navy : ; and in that sphere, amidst declining age, a defective Treasury, and the necessary surrender of his own trade, he successfully fouglit the battles of his country.

These Registers are now being printed from their commencement in the year 1541 to the year 1754. They belong to the earliest group of 35, commenced before 1542, to be found in Yorkshire ; and it is to preserve these ancient records of Kirkburton for ever from destruction that the work of copying and printing them has been undertaken. There are about 30,000 entries in the 213 years that are to be published ; and each of the three volumes in which the work will be issued will contain about 10,000 entries, together with an Index to each part. The first volume will contain all from 1541 to 1654 ; the second to 1711 ; the third to 1754.
The price of each volume will be One Guinea. It is hoped that the printing of the whole series will be accomplished during the ensuing twelve months.

The Publishers of the MiscezLanea GENFALOGICA ET HERALDICA desire to draw the attention of Authors and Publishers of Works relating to Heraldry and Genealogy to the desirability of advertising in the Wrapper pages of the Work. Booksellers will also find them an excellent medium for advertising specialities relating to Topography and Family History.

Pevigrees from the Cisitation of Kent, 1663-68.
ANNOTATED BY JOSEPH JACKSON HOWARD, LL.D., AND
ROBERT HOVENDEN.
The Editors, at the request of several friends, have issued these Pedigrees from ‘ The Visitation of Kent in 1663-68” as a separate Volume. Many of them have appeared previously in the ‘ Miscellanea Genealogica et Heraldica,’ but the Annotations have all been amplified, and the data specially authenticated. It is believed that they will prove of assistance to County Historians and Genealogists.
No County Visitations have been issued with Annotations similar to those here produced, with the exception of the Norfolk Visitation, edited by Colonel BULWER, printed in the ‘ Norfolk Archæological Society’s Journal, and the Suffolk Visitation, edited by Dr. HOWARD, two volumes of which were issued some years ago.

NOTICE.
It is purposed to issue both the June and July Numbers early in June as a SPECIAL PART. It will contain a Facsimile in Gold and Colours of the Grant of Arms to Tomas FLerewoon of London, Auditor of the Counties of Chester and Flint, dated 7 Henry VIIL., specially printed for this Magazine ; besides other Illustrations.
MR. and Mrs. EDWARD E. SALISBURY of New Haven, Connecticut, United States, are printing privately a series of
GENEALOGICAL AND BIOGRAPHICAL MONOGRAPHS ON THE FAMILIES OF
RiCurdv, Lord, Parmele-Mitchell, DBigho-Londe, illoughhy, Griswold, Pitkin-Tolcott, Oaven-Fobnson, and DBiodati,
INCLUDING NOTICES OF THE Marbins, Lees, De Ttolfs, and other Families.
It is not a mere collection of names and dates, but à book of Family History, as well as a genealogical record, full of new facts obtained in America and abroad ; a Work of great and ever increasing interest to present and future generations of these families and their allies ; and also valuable to genealogists and other antiquaries or students of history generally. The mono- graphs will fill from 500 to 600 pages, in two parts, 4to, and will be accompanied by twenty full chart Pedigrees, on bond paper, with authenticated Coats of Arms and carefully prepared Indexes of Family Names.
Subscriptions are invited for copies at cost. The edition will consist of 300 copies : the cost of 250 of these, bound in bevelled boards, cloth, gilt tops, with the Pedigrees separately bound, will be £3 12s. each; that of 50 copies on larger paper, bound with the Pedigrees, uncut, will be £4 4s. each. In this estimate no account is made of great expenses incurred by the Authors in the collection of materials for the work during many years, in America and in Europe, nor of the labour of composition and preparation for the press.
À few copies of the Chart Pedigrees, separately bound, without the text, are offered at £1 125. for the set, the expense of these being large in proportion to that of the rest of the work.
Application for copies may be made to the Authors, as above, or to the Editor of the ‘ Mis- cellanea Genealogica et Heraldica,’ care of Messrs, MITCHELL and HUGHES, 140 Wardour Street, London, W.

The Work has been already subscribed for by every American Public Library, and only a very limited number has been sent to England ; early application is therefore necessary to secure copies.

ANCERICA: FERALDICA”
Under this title is now published à highly artistical compilation of the Coats of Arms, Crests, and Mottoes taken over from Europe by prominent American families, having emigrated into that country between A.D. 1600 and 1800. |
It includes twelve full-page Illustrations, 15 x 12 inches, each page containing sixteen Coats of Arms, of equal importance, painted by à Prize Pupil of the Paris National School of Fine Arts, in gold, silver, and colours : one hundred and ninety-two Coats of Arms in all. The Text accompanying these Plates gives (with engraved Crest and Motto) :—Ist, the origin in Europe of each Coat of Arms ; 2nd, the name of the first Ancestor known to have introduced it in America ; 3rd, a short Argument concerning the family connections, if any, between the European and American possessors of said Coat of Arms.
On account of the great success attained by the first four Parts of ‘ America Heraldica, issued according to the original circular, the Editor has been induced to add to his first list of over two hundred names the well-authenticated Coats of Arms of about eighty prominent American families.
To furthermore complete this standard Work, the Editor has decided to give, as an Appendix to it :— 1. À General Alphabetical Index, containing, with all needed Additions and Corrections: A. The Blazoning, or Heraldic description, of all Coats of Arms contained in the Plates. B. An exhaustive list of old American families (not mentioned in the book itself) claiming connection with, and bearing the arms cf, the Titled Nobility of Europe, or Baronets of the British Empire (also with full Heraldic descriptions) —bringing the grand total of armorial devices, painted, engraved, or simply described in ‘ America Heraldica) to over four hundred, and actually doubling the importance of the Work. 2. À short Vocabulary of all Heraldic terms used in the Work, with necessary illustrations.
Parts VII. and VIII. to include all the additional information spoken of above, and five Coloured Plates, numbered respectively XIII, XIV., XV., XVI., and XVII, are now issued at a supplementary cost to Subscribers of £1 1s. for both Parts.
*,* No Parts or Plates will be sold separately, at any price, either now or hereafter.

MR. and Mrs. EDWARD E. SALISBUBY of New Haven, Connecticut, United States, are printing privately a series of
GENEALOGICAL AND BIOGRAPHICAL MONOGRAPHS ON THE FAMILIES OF Run, Lord, Barmele-Mitchell, Digho-Londe, Cillouxbty, Gristwold, Pitkin-olcott, Onven-Fobnson, and MDiodati,
INCLUDING NOTICES OF THE Marbins, Lees, De Atolfs, and other Families.
It is not a mere collection of names and dates, but a book of Family History, as well as a genealogical record, full of new facts obtained in America and abroad ; à Work of great and ever increasing interest to present and future generations of these families and their allies ; and also valuable to genealogists and other antiquaries or students of history generally. The mono- graphs will fill from 500 to 600 pages, in two parts, 4to, and will be accompanied by twenty full chart Pedigrees, on bond paper, with authenticated Coats of Arms and carefully prepared Indexes of Family Names.
Subscriptions are invited for copies at cost. The edition will consist of 300 copies : the cost of 250 of these, bound in bevelled boards, cloth, gilt tops, with the Pedigrees separately bound, will be £3 128. each; that of 50 copies on larger paper, bound with the Pedigrees, uncut, will be £4 4s, each. In this estimate no account is made of great expenses incurred by the Authors in the collection of materials for the work during many years, in America and in Europe, nor of the labour of composition and preparation for the press.
A few copies of the Chart Pedigrees, separately bound, without the text, are offered at £1 12s. for the set, the expense of these being large in proportion to that of the rest of the work.
Application for copies may be made to the Authors, as above, or to the Editor of the ‘ Mis- cellanea Genealogica et Heraldica,’ care of Messrs. MITOHELL and HUGHES, 140 Wardour Street, London, W.
Dedicated, bp permission, to Der Most Gracious Mafesto the Œueen. One Vol. Demy folio, 372 pages, with 30 pages of Illustrations, bound in cloth, price £5, THE FIRST PART OF À NEW AND ENLARGED EDITION OF
Hasteu’s History of the County of Kent,
BEING A HISTORY OF
Che Hundred ot Blackbeath,
The most important Division of the County, comprising the Kentish Suburbs of London, and forming a complete Work in itself.
Eprrep BY HENRY H. DRAKE,
MEMBER OF THE ROYAL ARCHÆOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF GREAT. BRITAIN AND IRELAND,
Dr. Drake is willing to undertake, if sufficient encouragement is forthcoming to justify it, the further prosecution of the History of Kent on à scheme similar to that on which the History of the Hundred of Blackheath is based, viz., upon the text of ‘ Hasted,” revised, recast, and enlarged, with information acquired by Messrs. Streatfeild and Larking, and with additional Notes by the Editor in verification and elucidation of the statements made.
As much of the groundwork for the History of Kent has been already covered by the Editor while collecting materials among the Public Records for the First Part, future Parts could be issued annually. The Editor alludes to this in the ‘‘ Introductory Notes.”

Genealogical Memoranda relating to the Family of Bisse. Cowrrrer By FRANCIS GRIGSON, Es.
ILLUSTRATED WITH ENGRAVINGS OF ARMS, SEALS, AND NUMEROUS AUTOGRAPHS.
Contents : Visitation Pedigrees ; Funeral Certificate of Edmond Mason, D.D., Dean of Salis- bury, 1634; Wills and Administrations; Chancery Proceedings ; Miscellaneous Evidences ; Parish Registers ; and Pedigree of the Bisse Family, extending over a period of more than two hundred years.
This Work is notable for the number and variety of its “ Evidences,” and for the discrimination and intelligence displayed in their classification and arrangement ; whilst its carefully drawn ‘ Pedigree,” extending to fourteen pages, is a model compilation. A special interest is attached to this book, inasmuch as it is the last genealogical collection completed by its talented compiler, who died shortly after passing the proof-sheets for press.

The Publishers of the Mrscezranea GENEALOGICA ET HErazpicAa desire to draw the attention of Authors and Publishers of Works relating to . Heraldry and Genealogy to the desirability of advertising in the Wrapper pages of the Work. Booksellers will also find them an excellent medium for advertising specialities relating to Topography and Family History.
Price for Advertisements : One page, £2 2s.; half page, £1 2s.; quarter page, 12s.; one-eighth page, 6s.
For Subscribers only, One Hundred Copies printed, each Copy numbered and signed. With full Index, etc., interleaved and bound in half parchment, price 15s. SOME

ANNOTATED BY JOSEPH JACKSON HOWARD, LL.D., ap ROBERT HOVENDEN.
The Editors, at the request of several friends, have issued these Pedigrees from ‘ The Visitation of Kent in 1663-68” as à separate Volume. Many of them have appeared previously in the ‘ Miscellanea Genealogica et Heraldica,’ but the Annotations have all been amplified, and the data specially authenticated. It is believed that they will prove of assistance to County Historians and Genealogists.
No County Visitations have been issued with Ahnotations similar to those here produced, with the exception of the Norfolk Visitation, edited by Colonel BULWER, printed in the ‘Norfolk Archæological Society’s Journal,’ and the Suffolk Visitation, edited by Dr. HoOWARD, two volumes of which were issued some years ago.

AUGUSTUS GEORGE LEGGE, M.A., VICAR,
AND ILLUSTRATED BY VARIOUS NOTES AND NOTICES OF FAMILIES RESIDENT IN THE PARISH FROM TIME TO TIME.
To which are added many quaint and interesting Extracts from Registers of a later date.
North Elmham, the seat of the ancient East Anglian Bishopric, a few miles from East Dereham, has an early Register—containing entries relating to several families of note, as Cromwell, Taverner, etc.—from which the late G. A. Carthew, Esq., when writing his ‘ History of the Hundred of Launditch, made several extracts ; but the work now offered gives the whole in extenso, in a complete form, which students of the late Tudor and Stuart periods will find handy to put on their shelves for reference,
To the Genealogist the births, marriages, deaths, and burials in a district or parish are a mine absolutely necessary to be worked if a reliable result of their labours is to be obtained. The Registers containing this information are often difficult of access, and much money, time, and patience have to be expended in searching them.

Pedtquees from the Erisitation of Kent, 1663-68.
ANNOTATED BY JOSEPH JACKSON HOWARD, LL.D., AD ROBERT HOVENDEN.
The Editors, at the request of several friends, have issued these Pedigrees from ‘ The Visitation of Kent in 1663-68” as à separate Volume, Many of them have appeared previously in the ‘ Miscellanea Genealogica et Heraldica,’ but the Annotations have all been amplified, and the - data specially authenticated. Itis believed that they will prove of assistance to County Historians and Genealogists,
-No County Visitations have been issued with Annotations similar to those here produced, with the exception of the Norfolk Visitation, edited by Colonel BULWER, printed in the ‘ Norfolk Archæological Society’s Journal, and the Suffolk Hate edited by Dr. HowARD, two volumes of which were issued some years ago.

The Ancient Register of North Clmbam, Porto,
FROM A.D. 1538 TO A.D. 1631. TRANSCRIBED BY
AUGUSTUS GEORGE LEGGE, M.A., VICAR,
AND ILLUSTRATED BY VARIOUS NOTES AND NOTICES OF FAMILIES RESIDENT IN THE PARISH FROM TIME TO TIME.
To which are added many quaint and interesting Extracts from Registers of a later date.
North Elmham, the seat of the ancient East Anglian Bishopric, a few miles from East Dereham, has an early Register—containing entries relating to several families of note, as Cromwell, Taverner, etc.—from which the late G. A. Carthew, Esq., when writing his ‘ History of the Hundred of Launditch, made several extracts ; but the work now offered gives the whole in extenso, in a complete form, which students of the late Tudor and Stuart periods will find handy to put on their shelves for reference.
To the Genealogist the births, marriages, deaths, and burials in a district or parish are a mine absolutely necessary to be worked if a reliable result of their labours is to be obtained. The Registers containing this information are often difficult of access, and much money, time, and patience have to be expended in searching them.

The Kegisters of tbe Barisb Church of Kochdale,
IN THE COUNTY OF LANCASTER,
FROM A.D. 1582 TO 1616. Edited by LIEUT.-COL. H. FISHWICK, F.S.A.
AUTHOR OF ‘The History of Goosnargh, ‘ The ITistory of Kirkham, ‘ The Lancashire Library, etc., etc.
The original Parish of Rochdale was one of the largest in the Hundred of Salford. It was anciently divided into four divisions—Hundersfield, Spotland, Castleton, and Butterworth—and it contained the villages of Todmorden, Milnrow, and Whitworth, and within its ecclesiastical jurisdiction was also the Chapelry of Saddleworth.
Although there were chapels in all these villages in the sixteenth century, Rochdale was the mother Church, and the early Registers there contain the only existing records for that-period of the Baptisms, Marriages, and Funerals in the entire Parish.
The earliest volume 'of Registers at Rochdale contains the Christenings, Marriages, and ‘Burials from 1582 to 1600, both inclusive ; the pages are of paper, and are so far worn with age and usage that before many years are past large portions of them will be totally destroyed. The Registers in the second volume are written on parchment, and are in a good state of preservation.
The Registers which it is proposed now to print have been most carefully copied, and will be reproduced verbatim et literatim, with extensions, and explanatory notes where required.
The Work will contain about 14,000 entries, and over 22,000 names.
The issue will be limited to 295 copies, Small Paper, price 105. 64, ; and 25 Large Paper copies, price 21s. ; post free.

EXTRACTS FROM PRESS OPINIONS.
“Mr. Head has enriched the literature of the county and rendered excellent service to the cause of archæology by a work which is at once antiquarian, topographical, genealogical, and historical, He has done his work thoroughly and well. Mr. Head is an earnest rather than an enthusiastic antiquary, and in his self-imposed task has shewn how much can be accomplished with painstaking care and discernment. He writes pleasantly, and as he travels back along the grass-grown aisles of the past he recalls many scenes and incidents of bygone days, and gives us many entertaining glimpses of old-time life.” — Macclesfield Courier and Herald, 17 Sept. 1887.
‘Mr. Head has shewn in the work before us how, by diligent, painstaking industry, by his researches in the Record Office, London, his examination of the deeds and charters preserved in the muniment chest of the Corporation, and other original evidences to which he has had access, a large amount of really interesting and instructive matter can be got together, and how worthy the town is of a detailed record of its formation, growth, and development. The volume contains a vast amount of exceedingly interesting information, arranged with judgment, care, and dis- crimination, and bears abundant evidence of the author’s industry and painstaking accuracy. It is admirably printed and artistically iilustrated, and, what is especially deserving of note, it is well indexed.”— Manchester Courier, 39 Sept. 1887.
“ Mr. Head has done for Congleton in an admirable way what Mr. Beamont has done for Warrington, and the resuit is another of those local histories which are simply fascinating to the antiquarian student.”— Warrington Guardian, 28 Sept. 1887.
“We can heartily congratulate Mr. Head upon the completion of a task which involves not only great labour and research, but judgment and discrimination. Such men as the author have scant recognition from the general public ; but it is certain that were it not for them the work of such more distinguished historians as Professor Freeman and the late Mr. Green would be increasingly difficult, — Manchester Examiner and Times, 28 Sept. 1887.

LÉB-ARNISION MEMOFRS,
Three Centuries of a Scottish House, 1571—1838. EDITED FROM THE FAMILY PAPERS
By GEORGE W. T. OMOND, ADVOCATE ; Author of ‘ The Lord Advocates of Scotland.
“"l'his handsome volume-—handsome by reason of the excellence of its typographical appoint- ments, and by a fine equipment of portraits and pictures, etched admirably by Mr. W. Hole, and of minor woodeuts and facsimiles—enriches the literature of the Scottish family history. It is perhaps best describea as a compilation of the domestic papers of the Arniston branch of the family of Dundas ; but the Dundases of Arniston maintained through so many generations a position of the highest legal and political eminence in Scotland that their history is to a very great extent the history of the progress of law and politics in this country.”—Scotsman.
“ He has done his task with taste and skill.— A#enæum.
“The documents from which Mr. Omond has made this most interesting selection seem to have had a narrow escape.”—Pall Mall Gazette.
‘ Regarded alike from the political and from the social point of view, this book, based chiefly on family papers, is very valuable as a contribution to and an elucidation of the history of Scotland.”—Spectator.

THE INDEX LIBRARY.
A MONTHLY SERIES OF
INDEXES AND CALENDARS TO BRITISH RECORDS. Edited by W. P. W. PHILLIMORE, ‘MA. B.C.L.
Arrangements have been made to issue a fasciculus of Indexes to the principal English Records, with separate pagination. The undertaking enables the student, at a small expense, to place a key to the principal English Records on his own bookshelves, thus allowing him to at once ascertain what information the Records are likely Lo afford him. As the official “reference ” to ‘the Records is also added, he can bespeak an “ office copy,” or obtain, through a Record agent, an abstract or precis of à document without leaving his own library. The series appeals to the interest of the Historian, the Genealogist, the Topographer, and the General Student, and must prove of incalculable value to American and Colonial Genealogists. The First Series consists of the following Indexes, with official references :—
1. Chancery Proceedings, Biïls and Answers, 1625—1649.
2. Royalist Composition Papers, Series I. and II.
8. { Signet ”’ Indexes, forming a Key to the Patent Rolls, 1524—1624. 4. No:thamptonshire Wills, 1510—16G49.
The Work is printed in à handy octavo form, with old-face type cast specially for this work, in double columns, and published on the first of each month. Each Part contains not less than 48 pages. The January Part will be ready on the 15th instant, Subscription £1 1s. per annum, post free. Single numbers are sold at 2s. each. A “Library Edition,” on large paper, is also issued quarterly : Annual Subscription £1 11s. 64. post free.

EP RE RC ES
OF ST. BOTOLPH BISHOPSGATE (1558-1753).
As I have now printed the Transcript of these Registers to 1628, I think it ecessary to put before the Subscribers the position of affairs. Tam simply Editor this work, and must consider very carefully the interests of the Rector of the . who has made himself responsible for all the expenses of this volume. TI
: “Church Registers,” nor am I disturbed at the slow growth of the List of Subscribers,
à r it is steady. American Archæologists are showing their appreciation of the value of such works, and with their sagacious energy set a good example to more sitating insular minds. My List will assume proportions satisfactory to men of ters and to myself —/zx7. : In the meantime, however, I think it prudent to
ts present steady tie I shall recommend the Rector to allow me to issue the Burials (1628-1753). I would print these before the Baptisms, for reasons which wili, I think, be deemed wise. ‘They are of special value as being exceeding numerous, d containing names about which inquiries are being continually made in Notes Z Quertes and kindred publications. Again, ‘The new Burying Ground of ? was situated in the Parish ; it was opened in 1568, and the names of
34. I shall printthe Baptisms (1628-1753), and thus complete to 1753 the Transcript of the Registers of the second important City Parish I have undertaken. _ Of course it must be clearly understood that, as the Rector is responsible for he expenses of this present work, to him belongs the right of deciding how far it shall proceed. I know, however, he is most anxious to see it completed, and I L annot believe the public will allow him to suffer pecuniary loss. It would not only be sad, but disgraceful, if such an important work were left unfinished, a monument of most unwise apathy. ‘There are many who know the value of such works, who consult them gladly at the Public Libraries, but who as yet have not put forth their hand to support them. The price is made as small as possible, and rely it is scarcely necessary for me to say that a volume containing 560 pages and nore than 40,000 entries will always command the price charged for it, viz. 20s., : the more as the issue is exceedingly limited ; and that as copies find an abiding habitation in the shelves of English and American Libraries, the value of the 3 emaining copies must greatly increase. I would impress on existing Subscribers the prudence of procuring additional names if they would possess the work complete, and I would suggest that some t least might take additional copies, which would be sure to meet with a sale at a higher price as the work becomes scarce in the book market. Above all, would-be _possessors of it must not hang back, waiting to see if it is likely to succeed : by so “doing they are doing a great injury. My Series can only be carried on “with a steady list of from 150 to 200 names ; when the former number is reached it will be ssible to proceed; with the latter number a regular and satisfactory issue of arterly parts of most valuable Transcripts will be assured.
