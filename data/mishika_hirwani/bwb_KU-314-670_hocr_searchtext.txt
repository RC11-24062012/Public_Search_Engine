How the just Antiques Year Book was received
We give below a few extracts from the hundreds of
congratulatory messages and reviews of The Antiques
Year Book 1949 received at this office, originals of which are in our files for examination.
Hampsuire Reaper: “Sincerest congratulations on a remarkable achievement. The Antiques Year Book is a credit to England, and will be of lasting value to all engaged in the buying or selling of antiques. In fact, they ought to erect a statue to you in the main entrance to the Antiques Fair!”
Truth: “To anyone interested in the collection of antiques whether silver, china, furniture, pictures or carpets, this book is an almost indispensable work of reference.”
Antiques, U.S.A.: “An informal tourist’s guide which will make you itch to go antiquing in England.”
Tunsripce Wetis Reaper: “I should like to congratulate you on The Antiques Year Book, a copy of which I got from you last month. It has a fund of the most useful information, is very will printed, and in these days a wonderful book for 6s.”
Tue Boox Excuance: ‘‘Wonderful value for three florins.”
The Antique Collector: “A new annual work designed to provide a wide range of practical information on antiques and collecting in this country at a really economical price. . . excellent.”
Hove BooxsgLter: “I write to congratulate you on your excel- lent Year Book. | think that the bibliography is particularly fine.”
Country Life: It would hardly seem possible that The Antiques Year Book could cram so much information into so small a space.”
York Reaper: “I would very much like to compliment you on turning out a very useful and interesting book, which has a very appealing human angle.”
HampsuireE Reaper: “An excellent publication and deserves a large sale. I know that I should have been glad of a copy on some of my trips round the country—as I look through this volume I see just what I have missed in each town that has been visited !””
CamBerLey Reaper: “May I congratulate you on your excellent book—quite the most comprehensive and useful of its kind that I have seen. I have recommended it to a number of friends, all of whom agree as to its usefulness.”
GLOUCESTERSHIRE READER: “I consider that your book will be of the greatest assistance to me as I wander round the country within petrol limits searching for early stuff.”

Introduction
THE great success of the 1949 ANTIQUES YEAR BOOK might almost be regarded as a romance of modern publishing. Letters of approbation were received from all parts of the world (the writers ranging from Royalty to mill-hands), and sales quickly outstripped impressions printed. The book became an institution overnight.
In preparing the 1950 volume herewith, care has been taken firstly to preserve the inexpensive character of the publication, which is still being sold at 6s. although it is larger and better and costs of production are very much higher, and secondly to meet the kindly-expressed demands of the reading public.
These demands have been chiefly for an extension of the most- favoured feature ROUND THE ANTIQUE SHOPS, and for more illustrations. Accordingly the “Antiques Dictionary” has been omitted to permit of our printing the most extensive literary survey of antique shops yet essayed, and it will be seen that very many more fine illustrations have been included than in 1949. A number of new features will also be found.
Meanwhile “The Antiques Dictionary” has gone back to the desk for prolonged consideration by experts in the various departments, and will appear again in 1951 considerably revised and extended.
Special attention is paid this year to silver, both in the publication of a unique feature and in the provision of usually unobtainable silver marks over several complete London and Edinburgh cycles. Subsequently the marks of other cities will be similarly treated.
A particular reason for extending the very popular ROUND THE ANTIQUE SHOPS feature, apart from the oft-stated demands of our readers, is the concrete evidence we have of the stimulus to trade (dollar trade as well), that was provided by the 1949 survey. Added to devaluation, we are told by dealers, our feature helped business to revive appreciably at a difficult time.
Last year we thanked many kind helpers by name. This year the list of indebtedness is so long, extending across the entire realm of experts and dealers, that we must content ourselves with a general expression of deep appreciation. To all true lovers of antiques, who have helped us create this second ANTIQUES YEAR BOOK, thank you!

THE Tenth Antique Dealers’ Fair and Exhibition will be held in 1950 from June 8th to June 23rd in the Great Hall of Grosvenor House, Park Lane, London, W.1.
The Fair is under the patronage of Her Majesty Queen Mary.
There will be about one hundred exhibitors from London and the Provinces.
There will again be a splendid comprehensive display of antiques of all kinds, ranging from furniture, silver, gold plate, jewellery, porcelains and pottery, MSS and books, pewter, old masters, to glass, clocks, prints and antiquities, and, as was the case at the 1949 Fair, it 1s anticipated that there will be a large number of overseas visitors.

nee BOA DA?
WE are constantly receiving inquiries from members of the public and from antique dealers as to exactly what is implied by membership of the British Antique Dealers’ Association, and accordingly give the following facts, which have been supplied by the Secretary, Mr. Mann Dyson, from the Association’s office at 16 St. James’s Street, London, S.W.1:—
Membership is restricted to bona fide dealers in antiques who have been established in business on their own account in the antique trade for a period of not less than three years prior to the date of their application for admission. (But the Council of the Association has power to waive this condition of eligibility in suitable cases. For example, in favour of a candidate who has had managerial experience with a firm of good standing prior to commencing business on his own account and is otherwise qualified in every respect.)
A candidate must:—{1) Possess a sound knowledge of the goods in which he deals. (2) Normally carry a stock of genuine antiques, that is, a stock comprising articles manufactured or produced over one hundred years ago, which have not been elaborated, reconstructed or substantially altered from their original state. (3) Carry on business from premises open to the public. (If the candidate carries on any other business at the same address, the antique stock should be segregated from other stock in such a manner that this is at once apparent to the casual caller.) (4) Be proposed and seconded for membership by members of the Association who are in a position to vouch for him as a dealer of integrity and standing.
Election is secured by vote of the Council, a three-fourths majority of those present at the meeting called to consider the application must be obtained. Entrance fee, Five guineas. Annual subscription (chargeable against profits for Income Tax purposes), Five guineas. The Entrance Fee and Annual Subscription is payable on notification of election. The Annual Subscription is renewable on the first anniversary of the date of election.

Two Suggestions
THE ANTIQUES YEAR BOOK visits all antique dealers and receives thousands of letters from readers annually. It has a unique opportunity for sounding the oceans of opinion, and accordingly comes forward with two suggestions which it knows would appeal to a vast number of people interested in antiques.
A - NATIONAL “ANTIQUES: SOCIETY
The first is for a National Antiques Society to be formed. This could well be sponsored by the British Antique Dealers’ Associa- tion—which is solely a trade body—and could be organised b voluntary workers along the lines of, say, the National Boo League, the Rose Society, the Poetry Society. There could be a branch in each city and town, with regular meetings to hear lecturers on antiques and with visits to interesting houses and galleries. Prominent dealers in each centre might help a lot—and benefit a lot. The Antiques Yéar Book would be glad to afford
publicity and print annual surveys.
PROVEN CLAE. | PATRS
The second suggestion is for Antique Dealers’ Fairs to be held in-provincial centres as well as London, on the American model. A very good start could be made in Edinburgh at the time of the Festival. Other suitable venues would be York, Birmingham (or, say, Stratford-on-Avon) and Bournemouth or Winchester. There would be no essential competition with the London Fair, as lower-priced, less important pieces would be offered for sale, and dealers would exhibit who could not afford the expense of sending goods to London even it they could obtain one of the restricted number of stands there. Once again the Antiques Year Book would lend all its aid.
Both suggestions are made to improve the facilities for antiques- lovers in this country, and to help the antiques trade at a time when new ideas are wanted to maintain that trade.
As we go to press news comes that energetic friends in Winchester have already launched plans for the first fair there.

Round the Antique Shops of London
An INFORMAL SERVICE FOR THE INTEREST AND GUIDANCE oF CoLLECTORS AND TouRISTS.
THE idea behind this section is to present annually an account of a tour of the British Isles in terms not of ancient monuments, castles, churches or bombed sites, but of—antique shops. Manifestly such an account could not be completed in a single instalment.
First: London. Some years must elapse before the entire vast antiques field of the capital is completely covered, and only selections can be given each year of those businesses which are chosen as typical of the areas in which they are to be found. Large and small will be described together because we know that both are of interest to our readers, and the turn of all dealers will come as and when they can be approached or can give facilities to our writers.
WES.7T. E-N.D
Thus if a visitor asked to be directed to one firm amongst all in the West End that is typical of the first half-dozen antique furniture dealers, he might be given the old name of Jetleys, 24 Bruton Street, which conveniently connects Bond Street and Berkeley Scuare. The writer of these notes himself had the pleasure of being conducted round the showrooms by the Proprietor, Mr. A. E. M. Smith, courteous, friendly, and wise. Here was a unique set of Adams furniture, possibly the only one of its kind in existence. The telephone rang, and Mr. Smith was speaking to an official about the furnishing of Princess Elizabeth’s new home. Canvasses of the 18th century English masters beckoned from another room. Commodes displayed their unique historical proportions. Not an article was less than the best or chosen for aught than complete authenticity. It was not difficult to understand why London remained the world’s leading market for antiques.
Or, if the inquiring traveller wanted a similarly typical establishment of the St. James’s area, home of smaller but no less
23 os
ROUND: TRE. AN TIOUELSHOL:
exclusive shops, he might be directed with confidence to the well- known Loewenthal home of antiques at 4 St. James’s Street, a few steps from the ever-charming old St. James’s Palace, convenient for the Clubs, and offering only the choicest pieces of 18th century English furniture, glass and silkwork pictures, treen and the like.
Or should he desire to be told of the representative gallery dealing in Old Master paintings, he could be taken to Number 13 Old Bond Street (Piccadilly end), and the lovely rooms of Leger Galleries. This notable business was established in 1892 by Joseph Leger. It is now carried on by his son Mr. H. L. Leger. During the course of the year important exhibitions are held of Old Master paintings, including works by English, French, Dutch and Italian artists, also very attractive shows of early English watercolours. Go then, to this chosen Gallery.
BR:OMPTON-.ROA-D
But surely, the reader remarks, you go to the Brompton Road area first when you buy antiques in London; and perhaps this famous district had better be described at once, in terms of good, representative businesses, such as, for instance, that of Norman Adams, Ltd., which will be found at 8 and 10 Hans Road, just round the turning at the end of Harrods.
Although established for nearly a quarter of a century (and before that at Bristol for many years) Norman Adams Ltd. always strikes one as enthusiastic and enterprising in its atmosphere, due doubtless to the personalities of Mr. Norman Adams himself and his associate Mr. Peter Methuen. You will find there only the choicest of pieces, each selected particularly for colour and design by Mr. Adams, yet priced and intended for buyers of taste most reasonably and carefully. The advanced collector or the young couple buying antiques for their home may each visit these lovely galleries and go away satisfied. So much for the outstanding and representative antique furniture dealer.
Now proceed down the Brompton Road and on the right find the imposing frontage of Messrs. Perez, the antique carpet specialists. It is an education to visit the seemingly endless show- rooms of this unique concern and probably to be guided round by a foremost expert in the subject. One room is devoted to prayer rugs alone, from which you could if necessary start your own collection—the best way to start collecting carpets. Tapestries, needlework, fine modern carpets are also offered, and all at about
24
ROUND THE ANTIQUE SHOPS
the lowest prices to be obtained in the trade.
The next recommended business is that known as “Gloria Antica,” next door at Number 170, where Wing-Commander C.-L. de Beaumont is a very genuine antique dealer indeed, in that he concentrates especially on very unusual pieces of historical background—a toothbrush dated 1795, musical boxes, relics associated with famous personages of the past—together with the finest English and Continental pottery and porcelain, also gooa furniture and decorations. There is an academic background here which should attract many collectors.
Specialists all, the finest in the world—as next in the case ot Messrs. C. J. Pratt, which will be found at Number 186 further down on the same side as Perez, and situated just where other buildings protrude outwards and narrow the road. Messrs. Pratt are the antique mantelpiece, grate and fireiron specialists, although they also sell general fine antique furniture and other items. This is a very excellent old firm, Royal appointed, absolutely reliable. and very highly recommended for their particular items.
Or cross to the other side, and at Number 177a Brompton Road, find the diminutive frontage of Mrs. E. W. Chalmers, the antique jewellery expert. But do not think that frontage is all, or that Mrs. Chalmers sells antique jewellery alone. You will get as fine a selection of the most exquisite old jewellery and_ silver as anywhere in London, but will also discover in other show- rooms a really excellent stock of 18th century furniture, particularly smal] pieces and mahogany offered by a very pleasant family which has long been famed for square deals in the trade.
Now proceed in this selective tour down the Brompton Road to Thurloe Place, where nearly opposite the Brompton Oratory at Number 9a is the establishment of Messrs. Filkins and Co., who are chosen as dealers in English and Continental porcelain. Furniture is sold, but the porcelain is outstanding, and this modest firm should prove a find to discriminating collectors who desire courteous service and sensible prices.
Which brings us along Thurloe Place (most conveniently situated for the Victoria and Albert Museum), to Exhibition Road, wherein, at Number 8, will be found the outstanding black and white frontage of Mr. Richard Grose’s establishment, possibly one of the most pleasing antique shop frontages in the world. And, as clean cars usually have good engines inside, so Mr. Grose’s stock is very lovely and most suited to those readers of

ROUND THE ANTIQUE SHOPS
this book who wish to have genuine, fine antique furniture but not at inflated collector’s piece prices. There are three floors, the stock is in splendid condition always, and the sevice is pre-eminently friendly and helpful.
FUL:HAM. ROAD
This area abounds in antique shops, and it is difficult to particularise. One could, for instance, return to Fulham Road, beginning at the left turn opposite the Brompton Oratory. This is another famous haunt of dealers, who are a little more homely than those of the more central area, but no less distinguished for outstandingly fine stock. Thus H. C. Baxter and Sons, at Numbers 191-193, next door to the Cancer Hospital, is controlled by a foremost expert on 18th century furniture, Mr. Baxter, who is yet the type of dealer to conduct you on a personal tour and speak without affectation of very famous things, such as the fine water clock he sold at the Antique Dealers’ Fair to Oueen Mary. This is a firm which also conducts a reliable export and trade business.
Or visit Mr. F. H. Webber, at Numbers 185-187, again helpful and eclectic, whose stock-in-trade on two floors extends from furniture to glass, and from porcelain and pottery to silver and objets d’art: an excellent and most friendly business with fortunate finds always for those who know how to browse round.
CRO W-P HERS
Or take the case of Crowthers, the famous mantelpiece, panelling and garden ornament people. The firm, T. Crowther and Son, Ltd., occupy what was once evidently an old country house at Number 282 North End Road, Fulham. We turned the car in that direction ourselves on a memorable morning, right down the Fulham Road to Walham Green Station, then, at the fourways junction, proceeded up North End Road till we became involved in an exciting street market. On the left we saw Crowthers’ unique habitat, and, entering, soon left the hubbub behind. i
The house contains many rooms with a huge stock of general antiques. There are some magnificent examples of eighteenth century dog grates with decorative brass paterals polished as new and a revelation of what can be done with such old pieces, then genuine Adams statuary marble mantelpieces; after which you enter a carved panelled room of stripped pine with magnificent overmantel, glorious chandelier, and period furniture

suitably arranged as for a great industrial boardroom (an idea for industrialists, who want to do the thing properly: consult Crowthers, and get only the best).
The house has an interior garden courtyard like an oasis in this drab London, with sufficient pieces of statuary and ornaments to stock a hundred great parks. Really, it is as interesting to visit Crowthers as to explore the Victoria and Albert or be guests at some fine country seat of the past.
SILVER RESIST AND WELSH DRESSER
But we must return: and to what greater contrast than, say, the fashionable Sloane area, and particularly to Sloane Square, because nearby will be found the representative dealer again, that pleasant connoisseur and friend to collectors, Colonel G. B. Drury, whose firm Messrs. Drury and Drury occupies a delightful corner shop of rare period interest itself at Number 40 Eaton Terrace.
Colonel Drury has a rare and most interesting speciality— resist lustre ware—but also stocks fine pottery of other schools as well as small pieces of genuine period furniture. His experts will undertake specialist repairs to fine pottery and porcelain. This business, in any guide to collectors, is undoubtedly a heavily- starred “find.”
(And while in this area it might be worth reminding the reader that Mr. Leslie S. Scott at 18 Motcomb Street, just off Belgrave Square, is an expert at the repair and restoration of candelabra, chandeliers and lustres. He does a postal business with all parts of the country—indeed, all parts of the world—and can be relied upon to give the most expert service to those who get in touch with him: very low prices.)
Sloane Street itself has several shops, and we offer as a typical example the old-established and yet intimate gallery of Messrs. U. H. King-Smith & Co., Ltd., Number 133 Sloane Street, a short distance up on the left from Sloane Square. Here are sold fine pieces of antique furniture at moderate prices as well as porcelain, glass, objets d’art—and Persian rugs and decorative lamps suitable for period furnishing schemes.
And we can conclude with—Welsh dressers. Sloane Avenue nearby has halfway along at Number 73 the establishment of Messrs. Leonard Wyburd, Ltd., which was outstandingly one ot the great pleasures of our tour, as we happen to be interested in much-maligned country furniture ourselves, and found therein
29
ROUND THE ANTIQUE SHOPS
the most exquisite selection of 17th and 18th century country- made pieces, all of the finest colour possible. Specialising within this speciality, Mr. Wyburd is probably the leading expert and dealer in the best Welsh dressers, and the examples we saw were truly superb. Do not on any account miss this establishment: which is also famed for carrying out suitable decorative schemes and undertaking really good restoration work.
P-ECG AD TEL
Now perhaps we can return to the centre, and particularly to the Piccadilly area, which abounds in interesting establishments, some of them very personal and petite, as, for example, the tiny “Old and New” shop of Miss Vesta Kittelsen at 26 Bury Street, wherein a young lady of taste and enterprise purveys pleasant pieces of period porcelain and glass and antique jewellery : she has Norwegian connections and can occasionally get some interesting Scandinavian glass and silver: or the establishment of Major Lionel Harris known as “Princes Antiques,” at Number 16 Princes Arcade, Piccadilly, a stone’s throw from Pan-American Airways, Fortnum and Mason’s and Hatchards. Major Harris sells works of art, pottery, paintings and drawings at very reasonable prices.
Nearby him, at Number 4 Princes Arcade, is for another example the interesting shop of Richard Ogden, a specialist in antique jewellery (unusual stock of garnet, topaz, turquoise) and also a collector of fine antique silver. It is suggested that both these enterprising and informed young men should be visited during any tour.
CHESSMEN
And, while on the subject of arcades, here is an opportunity to visit the most famous of them all—the Burlington Arcade on the opposite side of Piccadilly, with its history going back so far and its very individual and ancient trade customs still preserved. The Burlington Arcade has special interest for the readers of this book because halfway along will be found the remarkable shop known as “Emil,” (Number 16), wherein that distinguished collector and player Mr. Alex Hammond specialises most uniquely in chessmen, backgammon sets and related interests.
The Hammond Collection, basis of the stock, is among the finest in the world, but the owner naturally buys and sells outside his

own collection, and\can be thoroughly recommended to either the most discerning collector who is seeking, say, to match up a 200- year-old Siam set, or the humblest dealer who has a piece or set to sell.
Do visit Mr. Hammond, because, even if you are not interested in chessmen, his stock is one of the sights of London today, and somehow, once you have seen it, you begin to be interested in chessmen. .« -
WOOLLETTS
So much for that area. Which to choose next? There are so many, and we could for instance spend long pages in the district north of Oxford Street alone, Baker Street, Marylebone, Manchester Square—Wigmore Street. Once again, fewer a good representative must be chosen, and who better than the famous old firm of Charles Woollett & Son, who, at Numbers 59 to 61 Wigmore Street, run what is still one of the only real general antique shops in London. So many other dealers are specialists, or lordly, or ephemeral. Woolletts are good, sound and
et inexpensive. There is a leaning towards the finest porcelain, bee most other antiques are stocked, and the writer of these notes with a very wide experience of dealers would unhesitatingly recommend this wonderful old firm to the visitor who wants to be neither cowed nor cheated, and who likes to wander round four large showrooms packed with the most attractive treasures of
byegone days presided over by really pleasant people.
Do not forget, moreover, while you are in this part of the West End, that Messrs. B. A. Seaby, Ltd., the outstanding numismatists, have their fascinating premises at 65 Great Portland Street, which all should visit who have at one time or another taken the slightest interest in the collecting of old coins: also that Foyles the great booksellers are nearby at 119-125 Charing Cross Road, with an immense stock of books on collecting, and a wonderful service for collectors in many different departments.
MAYFAIR
Yet another kind of London antique business is that conducted at 20a Berkeley Street (foot of Hay Hill) by Prince Vladimer Galitzine, formerly in the Russian Life Guards and personal A.D.C. to the Grand Duke Nicholas, Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Armies during the first World War. ‘There is no

need to be diffident of calling at 20a Berkeley Street. The Prince, with the humility of manner of the true aristocrat, sells beautiful pieces within the average purse and will himself be delighted to help and advise his customers. Those who have failed to make his acquaintance may be said to have missed a unique opportunity in their lives. Pictures are a particular interest here—pictures in the period of the other antiques sold.
At the same time meet Mr. Anthony James, a young antique dealer with a big future and charming personality, who shares the premises of Prince Galitzine at 20a Berkeley Street, and specialises in small pieces of furniture of fine colour, particularly in the Regency period, and who urgently requires to buy such stock. There are already a considerable number of young married couples who have wisely bought their first antiques from Mr. James, and he is concentrating upon helping such new collectors at very moderate prices. Do not, then, forget 20a Berkeley Street, and the nightingales may sing for you also!
PEKING—PHILADELPHIA-NEW YORK
All this Mayfair area is replete with the stalls of antique fashion, and from year to year we shall try to describe the premises of the most suitable dealers. Davies Street alone is an antiques town, and we shall only mention this time the establish- ment therein of Messrs. Bluett & Sons (Number 48), wherein only the finest old Chinese porcelain and works of art are sold. This firm is outstanding in the world for its speciality and carries our complete recommendation to collectors—who, if they also require books on collecting subjects, may similarly be advised to step round to 15 North Audley Street, where Messrs. B. T. Batsford, Ltd., probably have the best selection and can always obtain difficult volumes (mention ANTIQUES YEAR BOOK).
Then make a special point of proceeding to Number 12 North Row, Park Lane, and the very interesting premises there of Mr. Alfred Bullard, friend to all and subject for malice to none. The premises have been ingeniously constructed from a former stables, there are many showrooms of fine 18th and early 19th furniture with the accent on mahogany, and Mr. Bullard is immediately persona grata with Americans, who know his companion business at 1604 Pine Street, Philadelphia. This is a very honest and good London dealer, with the bonhomie that comes from an American
sojourn as a young man.

And while on the subject of America, let us take the opportunity of recommending to English dealers an extremely enterprising U.S. wholesale buyer, Mr. R.

Then there is the historic City of London itself, famed in antique annals chiefly for—silver. There are dozens of renowned silversmiths and elas but we will choose Messrs. Hicklenton and Phillips of Number 83 Cheapside—between St. Paul’s and the Mansion House—as finely representative of all. This is the sort of London dealer you should patronise if you are interested in London antique silver, particularly of the 18th century. It is a personal business conducted by two very helpful partners, but its status may be judged by the fact that it has been awarded an appointment as jewellers to the Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen, and it is a consultant on City Plate to the old Guilds

and Livery Companies. Yet Messrs. Hicklenton and Phillip’s prices for fine 18th century silver are as low as any we have seen, being “City prices’ indeed.
And as the object of these annual notes is to provide readers with an up-to-date guide to what they want—and what the majority of us want today is undoubtedly good antique jewellery—so it is suggested that on the way to or from the City for silver a pause be made at the eastern end of New Oxford Street where Museum Street leads on the left to the British Museum. At 26 Museum Street will be located the renowned “Cameo Corner,” a unique business which during 1949 could be found crowded even early in the morning with fashionable customers buying beautiful and very valuable antique jewellery. Two features have made this business: the reliability and the taste of the proprietor. So the hint is given—‘‘Cameo Corner”’ for antique jewellery.
ROO AN De AND ABO -UsT
Lastly, the environs, of which a mere sample can be given this time: as, for example, of Kensington Church Street, home of the smaller but no less interesting kind of antique business, of which two typical examples are Sylvia Sheppard, Number 71 towards the Kensington High Street end, and Vera Bird, Number 174a at the Bayswater end just round the turning of the one-way street. Sylvia Sheppard’s have not only the main shop but also a showroom downstairs, which ask to see. Porcelain figures and interesting bureaux strike the eye—also the reasonable prices, and the trade can certainly be advised to buy here. Miss Bird’s is a most attractive white shop, selling porcelain, pottery, lustres, glass and the like.
Then there is the Hampstead area, which contains several excellent shops, such as that outstandingly delightful establish- ment known as Mary Adair Ltd., at Number 3 Heath Street. Do not miss this on any account, because an ordinary shop has been converted so cleverly by the two lady proprietors into an abode of charm and beauty—the brightest antique shop on a day’s run. Not for nothing have some of their pieces already got into “The Saturday Book.” Porcelain, pottery and glass are the specialities.

Cinalli, a young man who has the skill in his fingertips of a Chippendale, although he restores only for his own pleasure, and prefers to sell his small pieces of genuine fine furniture, his Dresden porcelain, lovely lustres, and choice chandeliers. Once again, this is the right stop for bargains. And, while in Hampstead, do not omit a run over to Highgate, where the old High Street is a lovely surprise for London, and the shopfront of Messrs. Nicholas at Number 76 is the most remarkable surprise of all, being perfectly period in design, and yet constructed by the proprietor with his own hands only a short time ago. This antique dealer is indeed, a very unusual personality, a natural craftsman and connoisseur. To meet him is a pleasure. His stock of antiques has been specially acquired to suit purchasers who wish to furnish with fine small pieces of the past at very low cost—often lower than the cost of new furniture.

The Year’s Best Books on Collecting
IN THIS SECTION A HELPFUL SURVEY IS PROVIDED OF THE BEST BOOKS ON VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS OF THE COLLECTING OF ANTIQUES ISSUED DURING 1949, EACH CHECKED BY AUTHORITIES ON THE SUBJECT AND GENERALLY AVAILABLE.
THE FINEST book as regards quality of production and
scope of subject matter for the ordinary reader on antique- collecting generally published during the year was undoubtedly G. Bernard Hughes’ Collecting Antiques. The credit for the production, as for so many fine volumes, goes to Country Life, Ltd. Of course the price ‘is high—two guineas—and the title is too wide insofar as Mr. Hughes confines himself to odd byways of his subject: Enamels, Candle-snuffers, Lustre-ware, Baro- meters, Paper-weights and the like: but the book is interesting to read on every page, with the true popular touch, and so delightful to handle, with its wealth of colour and black and white plates, that it should long remain a best-seller of its kind.
The same publishers produced, in The Artist and the Country House, by John Steegman (30s.) a magnificent quarto devoted solely to paintings and drawings of stately homes from Robert Streater to Edward Wadsworth. It is a lovely book, introduced suitably and with liberal annotation of the pictures, largely 18th century in flavour and likely to appeal to collectors who appreciate that small objects of art derive much from their architectural
background. 43 Cc
COLLECTORS” BOOKS. OF 1 fe ve Ax
Add to this a new work by Mr. Christopher Hussey entitled Clarence House, (21s.), and it will be appre- ciated that Messrs, Country Life Ltd. are performing a notable service to connoisseurs of the high interior. The work is interesting and of great value, not only because of its bookish beauty, but also because it provides a survey of the antique furnishings chosen by Princess Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh for their London home which is a liberal education for dealers and amateurs.
ENGLAND’S BEST
Similarly Mr. Ralph Dutton produced a very valuable “background” monograph in The English Interior, published with their customary rich embellishment of photographic illustration by Messrs. Batsford at one guinea. The collector or dealer who-has this work will be able to study the fine settings for which his treasures were originally intended. The pictures are the most fascinating feature of the book, and, almost pointedly avoiding reference to humble interiors, certainly teach us that we owe our finest antiques to the exclusive sumptuousness of long-dead patrons.
Again, the public-spirited Messrs. Batsford gave us during the year a reprint at 15s. of Richard Glazier’s standard work A Manual of Historic Ornament. First published in 1899, and almost unobtainable recently, this book describes and explains with hundreds of illustrations the various designs and shapes which have been employed by craftsmen in architecture, furniture, silver and pottery since the beginning. It is for the collector who wants really to know what is acanthus, ball-flower, and the Grinling Gibbons style, and the source of the scroll-work on ivory bookcovers of North Italy. In fact, it is an essential reference work for the specialist.
44
COLLECTORS’ BOOKS OF THE YEAR
Then we had English Town Crafts, a book from Messrs. Batsford by Norman Wymer at 15s., which should prove of absorbing interest to the antiques-minded. All the crafts of old English towns are dealt with, and our readers will turn specially to the sections on cabinet-makers, clock- makers, carpet-makers, silversmiths, glass-blowers and potters. Best feature of the book is its wealth of photo- graphic illustration.
fodd ds BARS 2 ART
_ And while in this general, introductory vein, let us hasten to pay a tribute. Messrs. Hutchinson issued during 1949 a splendiferous volume of The Year’s Art, to cover the period 1945-47, price three guineas. This is a reference account of art institutions, plus a detailed record of sale prices.
But there is a very human side to the publication, namely its identification with that most familiar and venerable frequenter of London sale-rooms, Mr. A. C. R. Carter (also contributor to The Daily Telegraph). Now in his 85th year, Mr. Carter has been associated with The Year’s Art almost from its remote beginnings in the eighties of last century. His task of editorship has for a lifetime been immense. Those who come after him with similar if more generally digestible projects such as the present Antiques Year Book know best what he has done —and salute him.
We also had during the year Volume XXV of Art Prices Current, covering the period 1946-1947, published at seven guineas by the Art Trade Press.. This is a compact reference work, concentrating on sale records alone, but as is known, most ingeniously classified and indexed, so that very valuable facts can be extracted after a few
seconds’ page-flipping. The sales of England, the 45

Continent and America are equally analysed to the last probe. It is an absolutely indispensable work for the very serious collector or for the dealer in first-class pieces. It is of occasional value to every sort of dealer and collector, who should make sure that it is in the Public Library if he cannot afford it, and kick up a suitable shindy if it is not readily available therein.
MARKHAM ON PEWTER
Then we received during 1949 a new printing of the 1928 edition of Markham’s New Pewter Marks and Old Pewter Ware, from William Reeves at £2 10s. As with the recent reappearance of “‘Chaffers,” something more than a formal greeting is required. Major Markham’s monumental work is of the kind that is rapidly proving one of the finest gilt-edged investments outside the gold blocks of Fort Knox. To purchase this book is not only to acquire lasting knowledge but also a property that can only increase in value. There are sections on the history of the pewterer’s craft statutes and relevant ordinances from 1348, on the manufacture and composition of pewter ware, and a description of some 1,100 marks or touches, with facsimiles of 200 from the original copperplates of the Pewterers’ Company.
From which it is not such a long jump to—Treen, or Small Woodwork Throughout the Ages, by Edward H. Pinto, published by Batsford at 25s. Here is another definitive work, but one that is also a readable book for its own sake. Mr. Pinto is a foremost authority. He has written the first, indeed, the only book that completely illustrates, systematizes, and describes the craft and the collecting of all those small wooden objects that come under the generic head of “treen.” There are 130. photo- graphic illustrations, and the book is easy to handle, most revelatory of the beauty—following close on the

heels of the silversmiths and pewterers—to be found in some long-preserved objects of everyday use.
MASTERPIECE UN THE MAKING?
And now for porcelain, which inspired during the year the publication of two important books for collectors, the first maybe the beginning of a masterpiece, namely the initial volume of W. B. Honey’s European Ceramic Art, from Faber and Faber at three guineas. Dr. Honey’s scheme for this magnum opus comprises the volume in our hand, an illustrated historical survey, to be followed by another volume at the same price in 1949 or 1950 which will be a dictionary of factories, artists, technical terms and general information.
Our opinion of the first volume is that it presents the reader with a magnificent picture book—well over two- thirds of it consists of plates, many of them coloured— which provides a complete conspectus of European fine potting from the 13th century to about 1815. Dr. Honey prefaces the pictures with a characteristically scholarly introduction. It is impossible to assess the value of the work as a whole until the dictionary appears. Meanwhile congratulations are due to author and publisher for essaying what may be a major work in the history of ceramics and carrying it to fruition in our own difficult and self-denigrated time.
The second book of wide general interest on the subject is George Savage’s Ceramics for the Collector, issued by Rockliff at 25s. The virtue of this book is that it deals with all kinds of pottery and porcelain from the beginning in all countries, with plenty of space allotted to the true Chinese source. There are many illustrations, and Mr. Savage—a dealer as well as a collector—has an informal, personal’ style of writing which makes for
readability. 49
COLLECTORS’. BOOKSé0OF THE YEAS
Rockliff also gave us New Hall Porcelain, by George Eyre Stringer (one of the principals of the New Hall Porcelain Company, Ltd.), the only definitive work on New Hall yet to be published. It is a lavish volume, two guineas, well-illustrated, and with full descriptions in the most useful style of typical pieces of the various periods. Anyone wishing to have a library on porcelain cannot afford to be without it: and one cannot study the pictures of those charming, characteristic tea-pots and those delightfully stylised patterns of chinoiserte without realising that New Hall is well worth the attention of the collector again and may return to a high place yet.
Then Rockliff published Glass in Antiquity, by Frederic Neuburg, price 30s., a German work which deals for a change with real “antiques’—those of the classical and biblical past. No collector of glass can truly appreciate what he handles without some knowledge of the fine—often the finer—work done by the craftsmen of Mediterranean antiquity. This Cae provides such knowledge, with plenty of illustration.
Another glass book, really coming into 1950 but made available to us by the publishers for the purpose of this survey, is American Glass by Lura Woodside Watkins, on Parrish’s excellent list at 15s. This is a lucid and interesting account of the growth of American glass- making, illustrated in colour and monochrome most appetisingly by the latest processes. The author makes out a very good case for the defence against those who are inclined to sneer at American craftsmanship. American glass zs worth collecting, and this book should be studied by (1) those who are interested in glass for its own sake, and (2) dealers in England who want to be able to identify the best American glass when it comes their way.

A byway of glass was traversed curiously in Lady Ruggles-Brise’s Sealed Bottles, (Country Life, 30s.) The subject is those bottles which from about 1650 on were sealed with heraldic device or the like on the shoulder— serving bottles used in great families—and, indeed, Lady Ruggles-Brise’s careful survey of the 800-odd seals in existence is a model for writers on collecting subjects. Hers will be the standard work on the subject, illustrated very thoroughly, and with a good American section.

COPLECEORS: BOOKS OF THE YEAR
other books published before the era of The Antiques Year Book |
We have on the desk certain of the series that have just been re-issued by Ernest Benn at 12s. 6d. each, namely Hayden’s Chats on Old Silver, his Chats on Cottage and Farmhouse Furniture, and H. J. L. J. Masse’s Chats on Old Pewter. We have seen scholars peer down blue- tipped noses at these volumes, and have heard advanced collectors make unpleasant noises at the sight of them. We know ourselves that Arthur Hayden was a minor artist and the dearest of good companions when we read him for the first time, and we are not going to criticise him now, just because we have advanced a little in the world. The work his books has done is invaluable. Hayden—if you want to start reading about antiques— is still the first author recommended. He has been brought up to date by the publishers in many ways. Masse’s Pewter has been re-edited by Mr. R. F. Michaelis, Librarian of the Society of Pewter Collectors, and given new material and illustrations. It is the best preliminary
handbook on the subject.
And since one of the Hayden volumes deals with silver we may take the opportunity to recommend a kind of companion work, American Silver, by John Marshall Phillips, published by Parrish very beautifully at 15s. The author is a foremost academic authority, but his style is light, and he very clearly traces the evolution of American silver from English models to native originality.
With this book we also received from Messrs. Parrish another entitled American Quilts and Coverlets, by Florence Peto, 15s, Our office boy opined: “Say, they’ve got the wrong place. We’re not a department store.” It was an opportunity to inform the poor lad of exactly what the collecting of bed coverings means to Americans, and

to show him, with the aid of this excellent finely- illustrated book exactly how beautiful was the needle- work of American women during that great era of the art, 1750 to 1860. This, of course, is another “‘must’”’ for the library of the serious student of antiques.
Who would also be advised to communicate with Messrs. B. A. Seaby, Ltd., and ask to receive regularly their Coin and Medal Bulletin (5s. per annum), their Standard Catalogue of the Coins of Great Britain and Ireland (5s.), and numerous other books regularly issued by them on the subject, such as H. A. Seaby’s The English Silver Coinage, 1649-1949, (10s.), which is a model for how such a work should be prepared, and absolutely authoritative and fascinating.

COLLECTORS’ BOOKS OF THE YEAR
to be passing through an arid period. Everything from wine labels to bodices is written about extensively, but the foremost stock-in-trade of the antique shops is neglected (save by the A.Y.B., which frankly confesses
to a keen furniture bias).
We have chosen one book for special mention in this line. It is Furniture: An Explanatory History, by David Reeves, published by Faber and Faber at 16s. The point about this history is that it surveys the subject soberly and adequately, but from a new angle, that of the joiner and cabinet-maker. Mr. Reeves is not necessarily a joiner or cabinet-maker himself, but he describes each period “‘from the inside,” as if he had been present at the birth and growth of each chair, table, bureau and period. The reader learns easily as the dealer learns the hard way, namely by getting to know first how the furniture is made, and reserving his raptures of apprecia- tion until the end. Mr. Reeves’ book is definitely good.
A “must” book for all who wish to maintain a complete furniture library is American Furniture, from Max Parrish at 15s. Mr. Charles Nagel, Director of the Brooklyn Museum, has written this fine and detailed conspectus of all the best American furniture from early colonial to modern days. The rich volume contains 65 reproductions in colour and monochrome, and does far more justice to its subject than most. Much American furniture, so depicted, is indeed very elegant and interesting.
Then we had valuable reprints and new editions. It is good, for example, to see Ralph Edwards’ and Margaret Jourdain’s Georgian Cabinet-Makers again upon the market (Country Life, £2 2s.). This is a survey of the work of the 80-odd chief cabinet-makers of the
57
century, with emphasis of course on Vile against Chippendale as is the modern tendency, but most thorough in treatment. ie
The same applies to a new edition of Margaret Jourdain’s Regency Furniture (Country Life, £2 2s.), and a revised, enlarged edition by the same authority of John C. Roger’s English Furniture ({2 2s., Country Life). Both are text-books dealing with the finest products of the cabinet-maker’s craft. Do not, of course, expect them to be more than text-books dealing with the finest products of the cabinet-maker’s craft; but within that framework they have no competitors, and any dullness in the writing is more than compensated for by the magnificent photographs which the lavish publishers have given us.
Also we received during the year a reprint at only 7s. 6d. of Donald Smith’s Old Furniture and Woodwork, published with their usual wealth of illustration in line and half-tone by Messrs. Batsford. This is a book that serves a threefold purpose. It is an excellent survey of antique furniture; a good textbook for cabinet-makers; and a manual with suggestions for study and work at the end of each chapter which could be usefully employed in schools and technical colleges.
PICTURES
Lastly a few words on some books about pictures that have particularly interested us during the year. One of them is Miss Rotha Clay’s Julius Caesar Ibbetson, published richly by Country Life at three guineas, and very interesting because it deals with a little-known painter and draughtsman of the late 18th century in easy biographical style, yet with all the force of original research. Ibbetson belongs to the class of neglected good artists who might still come anyone’s way in saleroom or antique shop, and it should pay collectors and dealers to
read the book. 58

COLLECTORS) BOOKS OF THE YEAR
Following closely was The Drawings of Henry Fuselt, published by Max Parrish at two guineas in a fine large quarto volume, written by Professor Paul Ganz, and introduced by Mr. John Piper. Since no previous work on this superb artist, the mentor and sometimes the equal of Blake, has been published since 1831, the book is an essential purchase for all who desire to be au fait with the growing cult of Regency. Fuseli was a superb draughts- man and fantastic artist of dreams—one of the minds behind the period, One could brood for hours over the plethora of plates in this noble work.
Another fascinating volume was Genuine and False, Dr. Hans Tietze’s new study of imitations, copies and _ forgeries published by Max Parrish at 10s. 6d. The wealth of fine illustration takes the form of genuine pictures juxtaposed with the fakes, and a careful study of these _ yields almost as much permanent knowledge as a life- time of bitter experience.
One more book planned along similar lines by Max Parrish for our delight and valuable instruction is Artist and Craftsman: Contrast, Similarity, Influence, by H. Ruhemann, also 10s. 6d. We who love objects of art no less than paintings and drawings can trace in this book how the craftsman has shared the work of creation with the “pure” artist. It is a valuable, fascinating study.
Degas is not yet an “antique,” but, among the Impressionists of mid-19th century Paris he was always sufficient of a traditionalist to produce the kind of work which the connoisseur looks for. The Art Trade Press published during 1949 a study of Degas the Draughts- man by Randolph Schwabe at one guinea which is very well-done and consists of many illustrations of the leading works, each accompanied by an explanatory note.

And finally—R. L. Megroz’s book on Profile Art, again by Art Trade Press, 25s. Most collectors have been interested at one time or another in silhouettes. There is at present quite a craze for these, and Mr. Megroz’s very well-written study deals with the whole subject, that is, not only with comparatively modern knife-cuts, but also with cave-man art, Egyptian profiles, pictures on classical pottery. An enthusiast’s spirit glows in these pages to produce a work of lasting value.

IF china has Chaffers and silver has Jackson, then the humble pot lid has at last its definitive Clarke—namely a fine quarto reference book entitled Under-Glaze Colour Picture Prints on Staffordshire Pottery, which is the only complete, authoritative, accurate and gloriously illustrated work available to collectors of the increasingly popular and perhaps soon to be very valuable pot lid.
This newly-published volume by Mr. Harold George Clarke, F.R.S.A., foremost expert on the subject, is moreover furnished with a separate free supplement that lists the current price of every pot lid known, together with a review of the faked and value-less lids. No dealer or collector can afford to be without the book and supplement, which costs £3 3s. plus post 9d. and can be had from The Tantivy Press, Littledean, Glos. Do not delay application as this book will soon be unobtainable or selling at a scarcity price.

THE MODERN GLUE
Coin Collecting By H. A. Seay
NUMISMATICS, the study and collecting of coins, tokens or medals is one of the most fascinating of hobbies, and is within the range of all pockets. No one department of antiques covers such a wide range of history and geography, or is so easily enjoyed. For instance, Roman coins are very plentiful, having been found in large quantities in this and other countries, and still being unearthed. _ As far as value is concerned, a collector can obtain from a reputable dealer a Roman silver denarius (the d. of our ye s, d.) struck before the time of Christ in really nice condition for as little as 5/-, or a copper coin of the third or fourth century A.D. for a shilling.
In the old days there were no banks and no paper money, therefore a considerable quantity of coins was required, and people placed their savings in the earth for safe keeping. Often they were killed or died without revealing the hiding place, and that is why coins are so often found in the ground today.
The new collector usually starts collecting any coins he comes across, but soon finds the scope is too large and that he must collect on a system or specialize. No one can advise him what to collect, as that will depend on his own inclinations or his own pocket. The following are just some of the ways or things to collect, which at the same time will give a rough idea of the scope of this very interesting hobby.
1. A coin of each English monarch; the collection later extended to include every denomination.
67
COIN COLLECTING
2. English crown piece 1551 to 1937, either by dates or by types.
3. English shillings from Henry VII to 1949, either by dates or by types.
4. English copper and bronze coins from 1672 to 1949 by dates or by types. This can be extended back to the reign of James 1 and can also include the Anglo- Saxon sceats.
5. English tokens. This is a very large series divided into three groups, those of the seventeenth century struck mostly between 1649 and 1670, those of the eighteenth century between 1787 and 1797, and lastly the silver and copper tokens of the nineteenth century mostly struck about 1810. These were all issued by tradesmen or by towns owing to the dearth of small regal currency. They are very numerous and collectors usually concentrate on those of their own particular town or county.
6. English gold coins.
7. Scottish coins and/or Irish coins.
8. Anglo-Saxon and English coins struck at local mints. In the time of Edward the Confessor, for instance, coins were struck in over 60 different towns.
9. British Dominion and Commonwealth coins and tokens.
10. Greek coins. This is a tremendous series covering the whole of the civilized world around the Mediterranean from 700 B.C. to the time of the Roman empire. Each and every town struck its own money and some of it is of the very finest workmanship. For instance some of the silver coins of the period about 410 B.C. are amongst the most beautiful examples of the engraver’s art.
. 11. Roman Republican denarii. A collection of these little silver coins about the size of a sixpence makes a
68
COIN COLLECTING
very fascinating study, and on the whole they are not very expensive.
12. Roman Imperial coins, Here the collector has several choices as to what he may collect but perhaps the most common is to try and obtain one of each emperor to start with and then fill out with interesting types.
13. Coins of the whole world of particular historical interest or of interesting historical personages.
14. Coins of the Jews.
15. German or Holy Roman Empire talers (crowns), of the 15th to 19th centuries. As every little princeling and ecclesiastic seemed to strike his own coins, and as they each tried to make a more beautiful coin than their betters, a truly remarkable series of coins can be obtained.
16. Coins of the Popes.
17. Gold coins of the world, say of sovereign size.
18. Large gold coins.
19. Copper coins of the world.
20. Curious currencies.
21. Oriental coins.
This is by no means the end, but it does give some idea of the scope, and also how essential it is to collect on a
plan.
Two words of warning: Condition (i.e. state of preservation) counts for everything in the value of a coin, therefore do not buy poor or second rate pieces if you can afford a better specimen; you will never be satisfied with it and will lose money on it when you come to sell. Secondly, do not clean coins except after taking expert advice, as more coins have been ruined by cleaning than by any other cause.

COLLECTOR. I LONDON
When started? From the year 1300.
Why started? To prevent fraud and indicate quality, not to provide modern collectors with information as to date, etc.
What are they? (1) Leopard’s head. (2) Maker’s mark. (3) Date letter. (4) Lion passant. (5) Lion’s head erased, and Britannia. (6) Sovereign’s head.
Thetr significance?
(1) Leoparp’s Heap: The actual London hall mark, really a lion’s head (originally) with crown. Diminished during reign of George II. In 1821 crown, mane and head were omitted. Since 1821 has taken on an increasing resemblance to a cat’s head.
(2) Maxer’s Marx: Came next in historical order. At first emblems, then (1696) two first letters of surname; 1739 onwards, initials of Christian and surnames.
(3) Date Letter:
When Changed? Each May.
When First Used? About 1478. Earliest known letter is Lombardic “B” in Gold- smiths’ Minutes.
How Used? In 20-year cycles, A to U or V, excluding J.
(4) Lion Passanr: First used 1544-5. Meaning: Probably “sterling,” adopted first to show that

the currency might be debased but plate thus stamped was still good sterling. Useful to us— because the shape of the punch varies in different cycles, helping us to check the date.
(5) Lion’s Heap EraseD AND Britannia: Used 1696-7 instead of leopard’s head and lion until June Ist, 1720. The Britannia standard has been used since then but only occasionally and is not popular because it erases easily. Be careful of “Britannia” marked plate with date letter obliterated.
(6) Sovergicn’s Heap: The “Duty Mark.” Found on all save very small silver articles made between December Ist, 1784, and April 30th, 1890 (when duty ceased to be levied). Profile of reigning sovereign’s head. N.B. Head of George II from December 1784 to May 29th, 1786, was intaglio

instead of cameo. Also note that plate marked with “4” (1784) is found both with and without sovereign’s head.
Il EDINBURGH Date of first silver-marking in Scotland: 1457.
What Were these Marks? They were those of the “deacon” or official, and of the working goldsmith. In 1485 the “Town Mark” or hall mark was adopted, being in the case of Edinburgh the triple-towered castle, which, in various forms, has been used down to the present day. In 1681 the date letter was first used, thereafter to be changed annually in September. The deacon’s mark was abolished the same year and replaced by the Assay Master’s mark, initials of the assayer in monogram script at first, then in Roman capitals, which remained till 1759 when a thistle emblem was substituted. In 1784 a duty mark was added, consisting of a sovereign’s head (indicating that duty had been paid) and continued to be used till 1890.
Position of the Marks on Old Edinburgh Plate? First, maker’s mark; second, castle; third, deacon’s mark. General.
1. Scottish makers have never been subject to the same outside control of their craft as their English colleagues.
2. Scottish silver tends to partake more of Continental than English influence.
3. Edinburgh has the oldest records, dating from medieval times, and has always produced far more than the other centres.
4. Marks were first used to deter goldsmiths from mixing alloy with gold and silver entrusted them by customers for working. Original penalty:
death. 72

) Antique Nursery Furniture and Toys
by
By Crarves TOLLER
THROUGHOUT the ages children’s furniture has played an important part in the furnishing of the home of both nobility and townsfolk. Much of this furniture has not survived the course of time, but there are some fine examples still in existence of cradles, chairs, tables and other furniture necessary to the nursery made in the
16th, 17th and 18th centuries.
It is only natural that the more sturdy type of children’s furniture has withstood the hard wear and tear to which it has been put, and therefore one finds more of the kind made for the country cottage rather than the mansion.
Cradles, beds, tables and chairs, chests and clothes presses were generally known in all homes with children. Cradles in the nursery of the nobility were often adorned with velvet or silk hangings, while those used by the country and townsfolk were less elaborate, being made at home or by the local carpenter, who would use what- ever wood he had by him: hence in this roughly jointed
furniture one finds more than one kind of wood used.
These less elaborate cradles had canopies, often hinged to lift.back or made separately to take off. The same applied to the rockers which could be removed when not in use. An example of the country made cradle is seen in the accompanying photograph, which shows a Crom- wellian cradle, the canopy of which can be removed.
83 E
ANTIQUE NURSERY FURNITURE AND TOYS
Beds have not survived in the same way as cradles, probably owing to the fact that fewer were made, as when the child became old enough to sleep in a bed it did so in a full sized one, or had one cut down for its own use. The few remaining examples of children’s beds are usually cane-sided, with the sides made to lift up and down.
Chairs were made in a variety of kinds according to the needs of the family. The nobility would have them made in walnut or oak to match an existing set in the dining room. An example of this is a Carolean child’s high chair with carved back and seat, the centre of the back elaborately carved as well as the arms and legs. High chairs often had an adjustable foot rest to allow for the growth of the child.
In the first half of the 18th century, when mahogany became the fashion, children’s chairs and tables were made to match; the chair being fixed to the table to make it into a high chair or used separately as chair and table.
As with cradles, the country people made their chairs more roughly and used a variety of woods. Examples of these are to be seen in the child’s Windsor and stick- back chair, yew, elm and ash being the most common woods used.
A popular type of child’s chair was the “commode” chair, the seat lifting up to allow the pot to be fitted underneath. These were often made as rocking chairs, and had small wings at the side carrying out the design of the popular wing arm chair. An example in oak can be seen in the photograph. One of these chairs I have seen had a tray fitted to the front for the child’s food or for playing games. Cherrywood was often used for making these chairs.
Specialities such as children’s hairdressing chairs are seldom seen outside the museums. These were made so
84
ANTIQUE NURSERY FURNITURE AND TOYS
that the child could sit astride the seat facing the back. Some of these chairs had a rounded rail for the child to lean on, others a head support—an upright bar curving outwards on which the child could lean his face.
Children’s chests and clothes presses were, in all probability, made specially to order and are now mostly in museums and private collections.
An important feature in the nursery and home was the baby cage, designed to teach children to walk. These cages were made of a light wood such as ash, beech or fruitwood. The most usual kind of cage had a circular piece of wood at the top which fitted round the body of the child. Four or six legs splayed out from this to a bottom rail on which wheels or castors were fitted. This allowed the child to walk without tumbling over. In a print entitled “A Buckinghamshire Cottage” the baby cage is shown suspended from the beams in the ceiling by ropes.
Next to a child’s furniture came its toys. There have always been toys and some of extraordinary antiquity can be seen in the British Museum. But rarely does one find toys earlier than the 17th century outside museums. Perhaps it may be said that dolls and dolls’ houses have survived the onslaught of time the best. This may be due to the fact that they have a fascination for young and old alike, and have been carefully preserved and handed down from generation to generation.
In the middle part of the 18th century ladies of fashion had dolls in their boudoirs dressed to represent famous historical characters or personalities of the time. An 18th century doll standing 2° 10” high and dressed as Queen Elizabeth may be seen in the Abbey House Museum, Kirkstall, Leeds.
Dolls’ houses were furnished in the period and type of house they represented—the furniture and accessories
85
ANTIQUE NURSERY FURNITURE AND TOYS
being made to scale. A Georgian dolls’ house I saw, exhibited in aid of a local charity, was completely furnished down to the coaches in the coach house.
Dolls’ furniture, tea, dinner and dessert services of the late 18th and early 19th century are still to be found fairly easily.
Here one might add a word of warning to the would- be collector not to confuse the dolls’ furniture and china with that made as samples and taken round by travellers to advertise their firm’s work which, although similar in size, were of far better craftsmanship than those made for the dolls’ house. With china, only one miniature piece representing a set would be made to show the design and colour. Doubtless these samples became
playthings for the children when their use had finished.
The rocking-horse, now replaced almost entirely by the motor car, was found in most homes and probabl dated back to the early 17th century, when all children learnt to ride. It was, therefore, a most important and instructive toy.
Toy animals, the dancing bear being an example I saw lately and dated about 1760—Noah’s ark, bugles, drums, models of coaches and ships—were all popular with the children of the 18th and early 19th century, while games such as cup and ball and whip and top can still be found by the collector.
In a short article such as this it is quite impossible to do more than briefly mention a few of the more familiar things which belonged to the children of byegone days, and I have tried to include those which I have good reason to believe do still exist outside museums and can
be found by those who may be interested in collecting children’s antiquities,

The Three A ges
By Donatp CowlE
I.—OAK
Forest-hewn and roughly-dight With the rose of England’s might, See these trestled boards remain For our modern, cool disdain.
Who prefer the legs of Anne,
Or the satin gentleman,
And can point with proper feeling At the repros made in Ealing:
For suburban welcome where Taste demands a wainscot chair, Or refectory delight
On a Jerrybethan site.
When—it surely should be seen That our folk are keeping green In their tasteless, faithful way What first kept the world at bay.
Heart of oak from native tree Which the adze simplicity Shaped into a proper throne For our sturdy flesh and bone.
Then with little woods inlayed, Decorated as a blade
Of Damascus which was yet Ready for the foeman met.
Cradle wherein lusty rolled Children framed by linenfold; Bible box and mighty chest Carved with arcade, dated zest.
87
THE THREE AGES
Stretcher table, bulging soon In the balustered balloon, Where the royal, panelled chair Like a Tudor stood foursquare;
Architectural design Hard-imposed upon the line Straight and solid of the wood That a Briton understood;
Oak that suits the simple mind, And is never cold, unkind;
But for homely atmosphere
Still remains without a peer.
Il.—_WALNUT
When Walnut came then also see In her train sweet Marquetry, Lady Lacquer, smooth Veneer, All decked up with dainty gear
Calculated to endear.
Frilled at first in Stuart mode (Ah, that naughty episode!) Then more sober as the Dutch With their plain and heavy touch Set the lasting style as such.
Cabriole and inlaid skirt, Calculated to divert,
Scrolled acanthus, serpentine Outlines of a lady’s line Drawn to Marot’s new design.
And for serving-men not rough Hewers of the joint-stool tough, But a new and softer race
Who make-up her charming face With a Latin skill and grace.
88
FTHE THREE AGES
Walnut, winsome, turning gray
In a lovely lady’s way,
Yet still causing quite a stir
As the queen of furniture
When she twists to show the burr.
Nor for her the country set, But a graceful minuet, Ever-turning, polished, cool As the mirror of a pool,
Or soft silk upon a spool.
Ah, dear creature, much we owe To your dainty-pointed toe:
And the age that you adorned, Though by modern monkeys scorned Shall, I fear, be longest mourned.
IIl—_MAHOGANY
Down with the blinds, Out with the port, This is Mahogany, Jolly old sport.
Home from the Indies, Hard, sir, and tanned, Uniform grain, Foreign and grand.
Chippendale’s friend,
Ay, polished enough—
Almost too much
When the French tried their stuff.
Carved with acanthus, Bulged at the knee, Fretted and fluted Chinoiserie !
89
THE THREE AGES
Then at the Empire Clawed like a sphinx, Flirting with ormolu’s Gold-digging minx.
Till at the end, What a dread fate! Good Queen Victoria Gave him a date.
Down with blinds, Out with the port,
Dead is Mahogany, Fashion is short.

Exporting Antigues Contributed by Mr. C. R. FENTON, F.S.F., Managing Director of C. R. Fenton & Company Ltd.
Due to the recent devaluation of the pound and the subsequent higher purchasing power of the dollar, it is anticipated that, in all probability, there will be a large number of tourists arriving from the dollar area, and in particular from the United States of America. It is widely known that the majority of our over- seas friends and visitors usually purchase some souvenir of their visit to take home, and certainly antiques take a very high priority in this respect. However, in view of the many regulations and restrictions at present in force, and in particular with currency and licensing control, it has been the writer’s experience that man sales have been lost due to the fact that the small dealer has not been sufficiently aware of the procedure to adopt, and the purpose of this article is to endeavour to make it easier for such dealers, and to debunk the forms and regulations which have previously seemed insurmountable and have made sales to foreign friends not worth while.
Having completed a sale to an overseas client, the first problem which confronts the dealer is the problem of dispatch. The initial step should be to contact a reliable shipping agent specialising in the packing and shipment of antiques. (A list of recommended agents will be found in this publication.) The local bank manager will. of course, be happy to advise on the currency regulations if a shipping agent is not available. The formalities to be complied with will vary with the country of destination, and are contingent on whether this is in the sterling or dollar area.
Briefly, the main regulations to be complied with are as follows :— 1. Currency control. 2. Export licensing for merchandise over 75 years old.
3. Details required for foreign Customs to ensure duty free entry where permissible.
None of the foregoing are at all difficult to comply with, but may be confusing to the small dealer who has previously only
91
EXPORT OF ANTIQUES
dealt in the home market, and perhaps a more detailed description is desirable.
Export Licence.
Permission to export antiques is readily granted by the Board of Trade, provided that currency regulations are complied with. Certain historic articles may be refused under licence if it is considered that they are of such exceptional merit that they should be retained in this country. It has been the writer’s experience that very few small traders would have merchandise under this category for sale. The only information called for by the Board of Trade is the name ot the seller and purchaser, the date of _ manufacture, country of origin, and the value of the article. For export licensing purposes an antique is any article manufactured 75 years ago, or more.
Currency Control (C.D.3).
This contract requires the exporter to surrender to the Bank of England all foreign currency which he receives against the export of his merchandise. The C.D.3. torm can be obtained by applica- tion to one’s Bank Manager or shipping agent, either of whom will gladly advise on its completion. This simple document calls for the following information :—
Name of purchaser, type of merchandise and cost of same, method of payment.
This form is produced to H.M. Customs when the merchandise is exported, and the duplicate copy is retained by the dealer, to hand to his bankers for completion when the money is received.
Recently the Government have relaxed currency regulations in respect of tourists making purchases in this country, and it is now permissible for them to buy merchandise in this country up £100 in sterling. All the dealer needs to do is to take a note of the passport number of his client, and to endorse on the invoice of sale a notation to the effect that the purchaser is, to the best of his knowledge, a genuine tourist. When making a sale to a dealer buying for an export house, and not for his own personal use, this concession does not apply, and the formalities just referred to must prevail.
Having considered the requirements for dispatch from this country, we now proceed with the data which is necessary to secure entry to the country where the merchandise is consigned.
92
EXPORT OF ANTIQUES
Most countries require the following information to be shown on the dealer’s invoice of sale:—Description of the goods, date of manufacture, value, country of origin, and finally, date of pro- duction. Each country has its own import regulations which may be in the form of invoices, consular invoices, or, in some cases, sworn affidavits. Others require examination by an expert nom- inated by the B.A.D.A., which Body will issue a certificate of authenticity that the merchandise is over one hundred years old, produced prior to 1849, or next year 1850. This document will ensure entry FREE OF DUTY to the consignee. With purchases made by Americans the B.A.D.A. certificate does not prevail, but a consular invoice, which has to be lodged with the American Consulate at a port where the merchandise is shipped, must be prepared. This document calls for all the data previously referred to, and necessitates the date of manufacture to be prior to 1830, to ensure duty free entry into the United States.
Quite often a dealer is asked to give an estimate of the cost of packing and shipping through to the destination. This is often not possible, and if a shipping agent is not easily available to give an immediate estimate, the sale is sometimes lost. This con- tingency can easily be avoided by having all the charges for transportation and packing sent forward for collection from the consignee when he returns home. Any reliable shipping agent will gladly take care of this for the dealer, and it only remains for him to make the sale to the customer.
I imagine that in reading this article some confusion may still be felt, but let me hasten to assure you that none of these hurdles need provide any real difficulty, and that provided you choose a shipping agent on the approved list of the B.A.D.A. they will do everything possible in your interests, and will gladly afford you every possible assistance and co-operation.
I hope that the limited space at my disposal has enabled me to give a concise capitulation of the requirements for exporting, and that my dealer friends will go all out to secure as much foreign business as they can in view of the country’s dire need
for foreign currency.

A Dictionary of Chess Sets
By Lt.-Col. THOMAS SUTTON, M.B.E.
NEARLY all information regarding chessmen and chess sets
can be found in the authoritative work A History of Chess, by H. J. R. Murray (1913), and also an American publication Chessmen, by D. M. Liddell (1938), but as both these books are difficult to obtain we publish herewith a simplified dictionary of the more usual types which may be encountered in complete sets.
CHINESE SETS are the commonest sets found: the red and white variety, with or without concentria balls, and with entirely Chinese figures or with a European King (George II or George III?) on the white side. The quality of these sets can be judged mainly from the pawns, which are sometimes very poor. They are generally made for the European market, and are really of small value. Turned and carved Chinese sets are also met with, and formalised soap-stone sets are by no means uncommon and their value is not great.
FRENCH SETS. The French sets are in a class by themselves and require special study. Finely carved ivory examples, with Roman warriors on the white side and either negroes or Turks on the black, are met with, and the Dieppe factory produced a large number of sets of fine quality with cuirassiers half-length as Pawns, and grenadiers on the opposite side, and the Kings representing Napoleon and Henri IV. There are, of course, variations to all these sets. Some quite attractive sets were also produced in pottery at Rouen.
GLASS SETS are sometimes encountered which have the appear- ance of having been made at Bristol, but they are very rare.
INDIAN CHESSMEN are often finely carved in white ivory, with majestic Kings and “Prime Ministers” (there are no “Queens” in Indian sets, owing to the Purdah system), showing these dignitaries riding in howdahs on caparisoned elephants. The Bishops may be officials riding on camels, and the Knight is generally a mounted officer. A single soldier holding a flag standing on a castellated building is the usual type of Rook. Variations frequently met for Bishops are Juggernaut cars, or bullock carts carrying a Fakir or holy man, or a sacred buffalo.
95
DICTIONARY “OF Cie S35. Sie) s
A rhinoceros (a rather revolting animal) may represent the European Bishop. Occasionally Indian sets are found with ships as Bishops—a “moor-punkey” or peacock-headed boat on the Indian side and a “budgerow” or Ganges house-boat on the European side.
Coloured Indian sets sometimes known as “Indo-Persian” frequently show the elephant carrying cannons slung on either side, with a mounting ladder hanging down his back. In these sets one Pawn may be found playing on a flute in a Krishna- like attitude. Occasionally each Pawn is different, but this is unusual. Many Indian carved and turned sets similar to the London Museum example, said to have been presented to Samuel Pepys by James II, may be found. They actually date from about 1740 to 1850; the majority being in green, or black, and white, with more uncommonly red and white.
There is also a well-known feature of Indo-Portuguese type consisting of human heads on turned bases with brilliantly lacquered head-dress. The black side in these sets is sometimes

in horn. It may be added that the Indo-Persian type, probably made in Madras, seldom has Europeans on either side. In those sets which are half Indian and half European the costumes are of interest, as the European men have pig-tails and a form of top hat alternating with the more usual 18th century three- corner. Some Spanish sets have remarkable affinity to an oriental type and may easily be mistaken for Chinese.
METAL SETS were made by most of the European countries, Russia and Germany especially. In the German ones, Frederick the Great and Napoleon are the representative Kings.
PORCELAIN SETS are greatly sought after by collectors, and the Continental types were made at Sévres, Meissen and Fursten- burg, all very similar in design. These should be treated rather as objects of porcelain from their respective factories than as chessmen. They are rare and expensive. There were three out- standing sets made in England. First is the well-known Wedg- wood set in various colours, designed by John Flaxman, and largely sold in Russia. These vary according to the base, which may be flat in the earlier examples, or raised (and much more attractive) in later editions. The earlier copies of these can be easily verified by the sharpness and crispness of the model- ling. The figures are romantic Gothic, and the King and Queen are said to represent John Kemble and Mrs. Siddons in “Macbeth.” Fools designed from Shakespeare’s “Touchstone” were substituted for Bishops in sets which were to be sold in France.
Another English pottery set which is well-known is said to have been made at Castleford, and is of interest in that the Pawns show soldiers wearing kilts, with mounted light dragoon officers as Knights. The Queen of this set may be found frequently in various materials, even salt-glazed examples are known. It would appear that this figure was sold separately as a toy by the manufacturers.
In about 1850 the firm of Minton produced a very attractive set in which all the figures are small children in very pleasant costumes and postures. This is usually in a very vivid green and white.

DICTIONARY -OF CHESS SE2s
RUSSIAN SETS made from mammoth tusk ivory with stiff formalised Muscovite figures can easily be identified by the fact that the Bishops are always depicted as ships. This relates to the legend of St. Nicholas, patron saint of Russia and also the patron saint of sailors.
WOODEN SETS emanate mainly from Germany and Switzer-
_ land, and frequently depict historical characters or relate to local important events. They are fairly easy to differentiate. A well-known type of ivory Swiss set was made at Berne, in which every piece represents a bear in some humorous attitude; the castles, however, being normal pieces showing a white bear prisoner in the red castle, and vice versa.
Willow Pattern
Im lacquered bliss the ageless lovers stroll
Upon the hummock bridge betwixt their lives, Towards the gold pagoda by the bole Distorted of the willow tree that drives
Its fancy grip into the cunning gilt,
With faded fruit enkindling on the bough, And sampans sailing where the fence is built Enamelled for a barrier on the brow;
And all is perfect, as the craftsmen knew Who swift discarded all save this alone, Where countless strivings suddenly accrue Into the single apex of their cone:
But hear the grumbling of our modern slattern, Who’s sick to death of dull old willow pattern.

The Packing and Shipping of Antiques by J. E. Mitrarp (a Director of Pitt & Scott, Ltd.)
PACKING and packaging have progressed far from the obscurity and haphazard methods of not so many years past, when the packing of an article was, generally speaking, an afterthought on the trader’s part. The importance of packing in relation to the trade of the country has so grown, that the British Standards Institution has devoted considerable energy to the development and publication of a new Packaging Code, whilst the packing trade itself has, through its members, increased in status by the inauguration of its Institute of Packaging.
Similarly, forwarding agents have their own Institute of Shipping and Forwarding Agents, the aims of which include that of maintaining the highest degree of efficiency and integrity of its members.
These Institutes are recognized by Government, Insurance, Transport, Shipping and other bodies, and are consulted where advice is needed upon technical matters relating to their activities. If, therefore, the work of packers and forwarding agents is of such great importance to the country’s trade I cannot over- emphasize the need for antique merchants themselves to ensure that the trade of the country is entrusted only to the people competent to handle it. These people, in the case of the antiques trade, are the fine art packers and the forwarding agents who, through years of hard-won experience, are able to relieve the trader of countless worries, and who strive to the limit to foster the trade, not only of their regular patrons, but of the uninitiated exporter as well.
Where is the satisfaction to the dealer who finds some rare piece for which he has searched the country month upon month, who gives it to an obscure firm to pack and ship, then after months of delay learns that instead of a delighted customer at the other end, he has lost yet another potentially profitable account, possibly through the piece having arrived broken or diminished in value through faulty packing, or maybe because transport, customs or other expenses have been unnecessarily incurred
112
PACKING AND SHIPMENT OF ANTIQUES
through somebody’s lack of knowledge of these most important matters.
I therefore urge all readers who may require packing or shipping services to ensure that their precious and _ historic treasures are handled only by the experts. Their names are easily obtained through’ the recognized authorities, or, just as satisfactorily, experienced dealers will always recommend a reliable firm. After all, what is amusing about the loss of a rare piece which, in the care of loving hands, has survived two or three hundred years of history, yet has not lasted as many hours in the custody of an incompetent packing or transport concern?
It is appropriate to mention here some of the services which a reliable packing and forwarding agent will provide. Few customers are aware of the obstacles which the agent overcomes in seeing that his wares are safely delivered to the recipient, and I often wonder if a second thought is given as to what lies beyond the vehicle which draws up at the vendor’s premises to take the purchases away.
Lorries must be clean, specially equipped, adaptable and reliable. Fully trained personnel must be used at all stages of physical handling; warehouses must be dry and safe—even air- conditoned for certain precious objects. Security measures must ever be to the fore—locked vans, for example; extra attendants, night guards and the employment of operatives of unquestionable integrity. Otherwise, the confidence of customer and insurance underwriter would soon be lost.
Packing must be entrusted only to men possessing many, many years of experience—craftsmen all, with records of up to fifty years’ service behind them. Packing materials must be of best quality, and in this direction experiments are constantly being made behind the scenes to the benefit of the customer. Problems arising due to unseasoned timber, the vices of certain materials, humidity, seawater, vibration, shock and stowage are all part of the packing firm’s everyday life.
On the forwarding side, the customer is relieved of unending worries relating to marine law, insurance, customs and excise, exchange control, banking, licences, consular invoices, foreign customs and many other formalities, all or most of which are related to every shipment of antiques to leave these shores. You may want a C.O.D. collected, and be it ten pounds or ten

PACKING AND SHIPMENT OF ANTIQUES
thousand, your established agent protects the client’s interest in every possible way. Yet to do so, the agent has himself—often through costly and personal journeys—to satisfactorily establish a world-wide chain of reliable correspondents in every sizeable town.
Advice on any of these matters and quotations for packing and shipping costs are ungrudgingly and freely given to all who care to ’phone or write with a problem. These problems are so many and frequent that volumes could be written and it would still be impossible for the average dealer to answer them.
So I urge, therefore, upon all who are interested in packing and overseas markets, the need to select your agent with the same care as you would your lawyer. The cheapest is not necessarily the best, as many a shipper has found to his regret, and having found the best, let him shoulder your burdens. After all, why should you have sleepless nights when there are other people ready to relieve you of your burdens? And these packing and shipping problems really do cause sleepless nights, as I can vouch for from my own twenty odd years’ experience.

A Dictionary of Antique Asta Munor Prayer Rugs
By R. E. G. MACEY, of PEREZ (London) Ltd.
BERGAMA. Rather rare. From area around the city of Pergamus. Shape of prayer arch or mihrab varies very widely. Narrow border stripes usually contain small isolated geometric devices. Ghiordiz knot; 50 to 65 to the sq. inch. Medium to long lustrous wool pile. Woollen warp; 2 to 6 threads of fine red wool weft between every two rows of knots. End webs with broad cross stripes, usually in blue, but sometimes in black, brown, yellow or white. Coarse weave, fairly firm texture. Colours mainly red and blue, with a little yellow, white and green.
ANATOLIAN. From the Anatolian Plateau. Designs very varied. Mihrab of central panel rises steeply in steps, while panels above, below, or both, often contain vandykes and pomegranates on leafy stems in the style of Ladiks. Frequently found in silk. Colours rather bright, and include red, blue, brown, green, white and yellow. Medium length wool pile. Ghiordiz knot; 50 to 70 to the sq. inch. Woollen warp on one level; 2 to 4 shoots of coloured wool weft between every two rows of knots. Borders very varied and of from one to three stripes. Two to three cord selvage, end webs and fringes. Loose texture, coarse weave.
GHIORDIZ. From area around the town of Ghiordiz. Antique Ghiordiz prayer rugs of 150 to 250 years ago were the finest produced in Asia Minor, and rivalled contemporary Persian products. Colour important: rugs woven in the 18th century and earlier are marked by richer, deeper tones than the later types. Colours mainly red, blue, yellow, white and camel; occas- ionally green. Ghiordiz knot, 65 to 110 to the sq. inch. Warp and weft of wool or cotton. Two shoots of weft between every two rows of knots. Short woollen pile, occasionally cotton. Mihrab rises at a fairly steep angle from flattened shoulders at the base of the arch; in older pieces the shoulders are often
115
DICTIONARY OF ASIA MINOR PRAYER RUGS
supported by a pilaster or pair of pilasters, while very old pieces frequently had a rounded mihrab. Usually horizontal panels containing floral devices or Koranic inscriptions are placed above and below the field. Border of from 6 to 9 stripes; patterns vary, but most usual consist of floral or fruit sprays arranged in a quadrangular form with alternate sprays facing in Opposite ways, or a repetition of differing rosettes surrounded by leaves. Occasionally the typical Kulah stripe is used. Selvage at sides, narrow end web and fringe. Fine weave, close texture.
KESHIR (KIR-SHEHR). Most striking and characteristic feature is the mthrab, which rises steeply from the sides of the prayer panel in a series of steps carried out in several parallel lines of different colours, the innermost line often being fringed with tiny tri-foliate forms projecting into the field of the panel. The spandrel is frequently of light green and is extended as a narrow line down either side of the panel. From five to eight stripe border, the main stripe being very wide and consisting of rather stylised floral forms. Colours mainly red and pale green, with blue, brown, fawn, white and yellow. Ghiordiz knot, 45 to 65 to the sq. inch. Woollen warp on one level; two to six shoots of woollen weft of varying colours between every two rows of knots. Varicoloured selvage at sides; end web, and fringe at upper end. Loose texture, coarse weave.
KONIEH. Great variety in the shape of the mihrab, but mainly similar to that of the Kulah. Latch-hooks project from the steps of the arch into the spandrel, which is filled with small geometric and floral devices, and a row of flowers or long- stemmed tri-foliate forms extends down either side of the prayer panel between the side of the panel and the inner border stripe. 'wo to five stripe border of a very geometrical character. Colours mainly rich reds and blues, with white, yellow and green. Woollen warp on one level; two shoots of red wool weft between every two rows of knots. End webs and fringes; two or three cord selvage at sides, though sometimes the sides are overcast. Firm texture, rather coarse weave.
KULAH. Flatter slope to the mihrab than any other in Asia Minor group. The arch is delineated by plain or stepped sloping lines. Colours of this rug are soft and pleasing, and consist of
116
DICTIONARY OF ASIA MINOR PRAYER RUGS
red, light and dark blue, and a distinctive golden brown, with some green, dark brown, white and yellow. The pile is of short to medium length wool, with 60 to 90 Ghiordiz knots to the sq. inch. Very distinctive borders of from six to nine stripes; main stripe of border usually consisting of several inch-wide bands in alternate colours, each bearing small floral forms at regular intervals. Woollen warp on two levels; two shoots of woollen weft between every two rows of knots (jute occasionally used). Two, to four cord selvage in mixed colours. Rather loose texture, coarse weave.
LADIK. From the area surrounding the town of Ladik. Very characteristic mihrab and spandrels. Prayer arch rises to three pointed heads, the middle one being raised above the other two by means of short straight sides. Occasionally a stepped arch of more ordinary form appears. Serrated leaves, rosettes, and other devices peculiar to the Ladiks appear in the spandrels. A large panel, either above or below the field, invariably bears reciprocal vandykes from which spring long, straight stems bearing leaves down either side and terminating in a device supposed to represent a pomegranate. Border usually of four stripes (three or five are occasionally to be met with) separated by narrow dotted lines; main stripe usually consists of alternate rosettes and Rhodian lilies, while the two guard stripes are of rather angular vines and tri-foliate leaves on short, straight stems. Colours are brilliant, mainly red and a medium shade of blue, with a considerable amount of canary yellow, and some brown and green. Ghiordiz knot; 65 to 110 to the sq. inch. Medium length woollen pile. Woollen warp on two levels; two shoots of red wool weft between every two rows of knots. Red selvage, narrow web and fringe. Fairly firm texture, medium weave with a rather flexible “feel.”
MAKRI (RHODIAN). Erroneously supposed to have been made in the island of Rhodes. Rather rare. Unique field which is divided into two or more arched panels, each of a different colour, and containing designs in strongly contrasting colours giving the effect of cathedral windows. Colours mainly red, yellow and blue, with green and white. Medium length pile of lustrous wool. Ghiordiz knot; 45 to 65 to the sq. inch. Woollen warp on one level; two shoots of red wool weft between
117
DICTIONARY OF ASIA MINOR PRAYER RUGS
every two rows of knots (sometimes varies). Loose texture, rather coarse weave inclined to be stiff to the feel. End webs, and red or blue selvage.
MELAS (MELEZ). From the district around the town of Melas or Melassa in South-Eastern Asia Minor. Distinctive mihrab rising from the narrow panel at an angle of 45 degrees on either side for a third of the width of the panel, then returning outwards to the border at a similar rising angle, and finally turning inwards once more to meet at the centre, giving the arch a V-waisted appearance at the base. Sides of ae and mihrab fringed with small floral forms, while the field usually contains odd diamond-shaped devices, which are sometimes linked together by a thin line. Spandrel, usually of ivory, bears stylised floral forms, while the very broad main stripe of the border usually contains large palmettes interspersed with highly conventionalised floral forms.

HEREVER small round holes about 1/16th of an inch in
diameter are found in furniture, it is described as having been attacked by “woodworm.” This is not a particularly apt description, since the creature that does the damage is not a “worm” in the scientific sense of the word, but merely a grub of the Furniture Beetle (Anobium Punctatum).
It is a pity that the average man does not know more about the habits of this pest—greater knowledge would help in keeping down the beetle population, which is already large, and which is almost certainly increasing.
The Furniture Beetle is dangerous, because it is found every- where, under natural conditions living in the dead branches of trees.
The beetles can fly, and can invade dwelling houses and infect either furniture or structural timbers, such as floorboards or joists.
The Furniture Beetle goes through the series of changes known as the metamorphosis. That is to say, the female lays her eggs in crevices or joints of a piece of furniture. A small grub hatches out, which at once begins to bore a tunnel in the wood. The grub—the “woodworm”—makes the tunnels because it feeds upon wood, which is digested and then excreted in the form of small cigar-shaped pellets.
In furniture this continues usually for two years, and then the grub turns first into a pupa or chrysalis—and then into an adult beetle. This happens in the spring, and from June to August the adults emerge from the wood, biting the hole seen on the surface in order to escape..The beetles mate and the females lay about 20 eggs each, and so another generation starts. The adults, small brown beetles about 3/16ths of an inch long, are rarely seen. They die soon after mating and laying.
It is this curious “life cycle,” as it is called, that gives us the key to the correct treatment of wood that has been attacked.
123 )
THE “CARE: OF (AN TIOP Es
Nothing much can be done about the beetles—the attack must be on the grubs. First of all get as much powder as possible out of the holes, then feed in a reliable insecticide. Allow the liquid to sink into the holes, and go on doing this until no more is absorbed. Treat crevices, joints and cracks where eggs may have been laid. When this is done, the grubs are killed where the liquid reaches them, and more than this—the tunnels commun- icate, and the liquid creeps into the interior of the wood, and renders it uneatable. The treatment may have to be continued for several years, until no more fresh holes appear. Usually one treatment is enough.
Here are certain points to remember about insect attack on furniture :—
Sometimes an attack may have died out many years ago—the holes in this case are darkened inside. An active attack is shown by clean cut holes, often filled with powder.
Never stop the holes with wax—they are the only means of introducing the insecticide into the wood, and dealing with the grubs.
All wood that is well seasoned is liable to attack—and speaking generally, most kinds of timber used in furniture-making is acceptable to the beetles.
The Lyctus or Powder Post Beetle, which had a good deal of publicity in connection with its attacks on “utility” furniture, will never be found in a genuine antique—since wood that has been felled more than 20 years is immune from Lyctus attack.

CREAM POLISHING
THE polishing of furniture is an important function apart from the pleasing appearance which is achieved by the operation, and great care should be taken in choosing a furniture cream which has all the necessary qualities. Furniture creams differ from the paste type wax polishes in that they are wax polishes which have been emulsified with water in which various cleaning agents are incorporated. The advantage of the emulsified form of polish is that the water phase is absorbed by the cloth used for application (cotton being the most suitable), whilst the wax is deposited on the surface to which the polish | is applied. The portion of the pad thus wetted with the furniture
124
THE: CARE OF ANTIQUES
cream then collects all the dust and dirt as the wax is being applied, and by using a circular motion all the pores of the wood are filled with waxes, which carry with them other ingredients to impart the required characteristics to the film of wax which is to remain. After the solvents have evaporated from the wax the final polishing can be done, and for this purpose a flannel polishing pad is recommended. The direction of rubbing should be first across the grain and then with the grain.
All furniture creams will fulfil these functions, but the quality of the furniture cream is dependant on the properties of the wax film which is left behind. One famous firm have been manufacturing an emulsified cream for the past 80 years, and they make use of a blend of several waxes to ensure that the residual film is resistant to damp, dust and heat, and has sufficient hardness to resist smearing through rubbing or finger marking. In addition to these characteristics the waxes chosen are colourless, so that the natural appearance of the wood to which it is applied is unchanged, and for this reason the cream can be used with equal satisfaction on new or antique furniture.
In treating new wood there is no need for any preliminary work
‘to be done, as the piece of furniture can be polished from the scraping or sand-papering stage, and can be given a superb wax finish by repeated applications of cream. On the other hand a newly acquired antique piece which has perhaps been polished with a paste type wax polish, or an emulsified form of unsuitable waxes, will respond to treatment with cream. Layer upon layer of soft wax into which dirt has become embedded can easily be wiped away after giving a liberal application of cream, revealing the natural beauty of the wood.

ENS URANCE AND: FIRE: RISK
THE importance of covering property, antiques, works of art, etc., against fire damage is generally accepted but it is surprising how often it appears that full advantage has not been taken of the protection available, through failure to insure for full value.
Fire insurance rates, unlike most services and commodities, have not been subject to any general increase either during or since the war, and the premiums charged for this cover are very moderate. The possibility of a total loss is always present and it is
125
THE CARE OF ANTIQUES
false economy to endeavour to reduce premium costs by insuring for less than full value and thereby run the risk of a substantial loss not fully covered by the policy.
This is particularly important at the present time when a general scaling up of prices has taken place during the past few years, and policyholders whose insurances have not recently been revised would do well to review their cover now, making allowance at the same time for any anticipated rise in values in the near future. If constant adjustment of the policy is to be avoided the sum insured on contents should be sufficient to cover the maximum value at risk at any time during the currency of the policy. Where the sums insured on Stock are large—say £10,000 or over—and these values are subject to considerable fluctuation, a declaration form of cover may be available. This provides for the fixing of @ maximum sum insured with monthly declarations of the amounts which are actually at risk, the premium being adjusted at the end of each year of insurance on the basis of these declarations.
The standard fire policy covers damage or destruction by fire and lightning and also explosion of boilers used for domestic

purposes and of gas used for domestic purposes or for lighting or heating the building. Full explosion cover may be obtained for a small additional premium. Other perils frequently added are aircraft, riot and civil commotion, earthquake, storm, tempest, flood, water damage arising from burst pipes and other apparatus, and impact by road vehicles, horses or cattle. Cover for storm, tempest, flood and burst pipes is subject to an excess, normally of £5, which means that the insured bears the first small amount of any loss.
Rates charged for fire insurance depend on various factors revealed following an inspection by the insurance company’s surveyor. Predominant points are the construction, heating and lighting of the buildings, the nature of the occupancy of the other tenants, if any, and so far as the insured’s own portion of the premises is concerned, the existence and amount of furniture repairing, upholstering, polishing and touching-up done and the quantities of inflammable materials stored. A surveyor will always be ready to offer suggestions for improvement in the risk to qualify for the lowest rates. The introduction of fire extinguishing appliances, and in the larger premises of automatic fire alarms and sprinkler systems, is usually well worth considering with this end in view. Although the capital outlay which the latter involve may be substantial, the large discounts granted from the premium make this well worth while.
Where substantial sums insured are involved a discount may be granted in return for an agreement to continue the insurance for a period of not less than three years. Apart from the saving of premium involved, this has the advantage to the insured of fixing the terms of the insurance for the period, with the exception of alterations in rating arising from a material change in the nature of the risk.
Although the impact of a fire loss is passed from the individual to the insurance company, and this in turn is often spread by an extensive system of reinsurance to a large number of insurers, the final burden of the loss is borne by the community at large. It is important, therefore, to reduce fire losses to a minimum— not only in order that fire insurance rates may be kept at the resent low level, but also to preserve the national wealth. The staffs of the fire insurance companies are ready to advise on all precautions and improvements which may be adopted to attain this end.

THE CARE OF ANTIQUES WAX 2P:O LP SAVING
Many people who have purchased wax polish in the past have failed to get the results they expected, not only with chilled wax, but many other types. They have therefore let the most beautiful and the simplest way of polishing pass them by.
When using french polish or varnish, the body of the work is built up, each coat being rubbed down, therefore making a smooth surface for the final coat. This is not so in wax polishing. The smooth surface must be there first, and a few extra minutes with a fine sandpaper is all that is required. This is most essential. Many apply the wax and try to polish it at once. No results will be obtained if this is done. The coating of wax must be left until the solvents have dried out. The longer you can let the work stand before the final polish the better. Spirits or solvents are only added to the wax to make the application easy; they have no polishing powers and must dry out, leaving a thin skin of pure wax.
Many have trouble when the work is stained. This is only natural; the spirits lift the stain. When stain is used, always use a sealer or a thin shellac polish before you apply the wax. This will fix the stain and and when rubbed down forms a hard top for the wax. This method can of course be used on unstained work, and is a great advantage. Where a high class cabinet finish is required, the grain should be filled with a good class wood filler. But this must be dry and hard before either sealer or wax are applied. The whole secret of any finish is, each coat must be dry before another is added to it. This fact is lost sight of in many cases. It is just like applying a second coat of paint before the Ges is dry. In the old days all wax polishing was with beeswax and turpentine and years of continuous rubbing brought up that wonderful eggshell gloss, which is so admired in old furniture. To-day we claim the same finish can be obtained in a few minutes if you make proper use of chilled wax.

THE CARE OF OLD PAINTINGS
Many oil paintings hang in this country from which the beauty has vanished beneath the dirt and discoloration of the ages. Such pictures frequently come into the hands of collectors and dealers who wonder what to do about them. Professional restorers are not always available or within the purse. Here is a tip.
Modern chemistry has now produced a proprietary preparation costing only a few shillings a bottle—an emulsion—which a child can use. Its action is to clean varnished oil paintings without removing the varnish. It permeates the entire substance of the varnish, releasing and bringing to the surface that matter which caused the darkening and discoloration.
To gain confidence in your ability to do a good job you try a small corner of the picture and immediately see how simple it is to remove the dirt.
Take the oil painting out of its frame, and lay on flat surface. Shake the bottle and the emulsion will turn milky white, when it is ready for use. Soak a swab of cotton wool with the emulsion and apply to the varnished picture with a slow rotary motion. It is not necessary to rub hard.
The emulsion will show results almost immediately. Watch the cotton wool; it will start turning a muddy yellow, which is a sign to begin again with a clean swab of cotton wool.
Repeat the process till the whole surface of the varnished picture has been cleaned. Several applications may be necessary over the same area, depending on the degree of discoloration; and they can be made with full confidence, for at no time does the emulsion remove the varnish. When the picture is cleaned to your satisfaction, take a clean swab of cotton wool, moisten with the emulsion, well squeeze it out, and dry off by drawing the squeezed cotton wool across the picture in one direction from top to bottom.
For a few shillings and a quarter of an hour’s labour you have
restored to its pristine bright colours a picture that may now be
worth ten times its original value. Lestie F. Wess.

DRY ROwd SPN eA NT POU ER TIM BE RS ANB BUILD EN GS
FUNGAL decay of timber is generally referred to as “Dry Rot,” not because it occurs in dry conditions but because of its ultimate effect on the wood. There are several common types, all of which cause timber to decay, but which vary in their power to spread. ALL ARE CAUSED BY DAMP AND LACK OF VENTILATION.
Broadly speaking, the architect or builder need only think of two general divisions; one division occupied very fully with the menacing, virulent Merulius lacrymans, and the other with all the other forms of Dry Rot. If an architect or builder can identify Merulius in all its manifestations, then he can regard any fungus which he cannot identify as coming into the other division.
If Merulius is identified, then the business of eradicating it will, almost certainly, be expensive and involve the stripping of timber, plaster and, possibly, brickwork, masonry, plumbing and goodness knows what else. But if one of the other species of fungus is the cause of the rot, then it is probable that drying out, the application of chemical control treatment and some slight structural modification will successfully destroy it and prevent its recurrence.
POPNLETEICATION “OF “MERULIUS
Usually, the first indication of the presence of Merulius is the appearance of cracks in skirting boards, door and window linings, shutter cases, etc. The wood bulges until the surface is convex and shrinks so that the joints open and gaps appear in the paint. Quite often a white rubbery cushion appears on the edges of skirting boards, picture rails, ceilings or walls or even on the outside of the house. This cushion soon blossoms into a fleshy pancake, at first pale grey with tinges of lilac, but turning a bright rusty- red as the spores are formed, fading to dark brown as the plant ages and all nourishment has been sucked from the timber on which it is rooted. This is the fruiting or spore-bearing body called the Sporophore which corresponds to the flower, and the spores to the seeds of higher plant life.
The spores are liberated in such profusion that a wide area surrounding a ripe sporophore is often covered with brick-red
131
THE CARE OF ANTIQUES
dust of so fine a character that the individual spores can only be seen with the aid of a powerful microscope. When Merulius is growing beneath a floor or behind a wall space and has given no external sign of its presence, it has often been detected by the the appearance of the dull red dust in cupboards and along the joints in the floor boards, etc. As the sporophore only develops after the fungal plant is well established, the sight of one, or more, is a certain indication that there is a very extensive growth hidden somewhere behind the floor boards, ceilings or walls. If the fungus has not been established very long, cr if the conditions of humidity are not encouraging to its growth, then no sporophore is formed and we must look for other clues by which to identify it.
When the suspected area is opened up and the fungal growth exposed to view, the first clue may be the smell. If it is Merulius in an active and growing state, then a strong Rss ene odour is apparent, which spreads throughout the house. If the growth is old and dormant, then the smell may be quite faint but still characteristic.
‘ER. EBsASE.M EN. T
Firstly, it is necessary to locate the full extent of the fungal growth or growths, so I suggest the first thing an architect or builder should do when asked to deal with Dry Rot is to take a careful look at the outside of the building. He should then make a note of any signs of damp, where green patches appear, where leaks from gutters or overflows from stack hopper heads or stack pipe joints have caused dark runs down the wall, where the soil or pavement has been built above the level of the damp-course, if any; where window sills are cracked, or coping stones dislodged, joints open, etc., and he will, probably, find his cause and know where to look when he enters the building. I have often been asked to look at an outbreak of Dry Rot and have detected several others from clues detected on the outside of the building. When the affected area has been located, the extent of the hidden growth is not easy to visualise without a great deal of experience and the help of an illuminated magnifier.
Some idea of its extent may be formed by probing the wood and by the discoloured and blistered appearance of the plaster. If Dry Rot is known to be present, any flaking or bulging of plaster should be regarded with suspicion. Dry Rot fungus liberates a considerable volume of carbon dioxide gas and this may
132
THE CARE OF ANTIQUES
be responsible for the separation of the plaster from the wall. Damp patches on plaster may be caused by the fungus, so they should be investigated. Opening up to investigate the extent of the rot is often a heart-breaking business and requires the ruthless outlook of a successful general.
Nothing must stop the investigator from disclosing every inch of the fungal plant and, at least, eighteen inches beyond the last visible sign of growth. It is often difficult to detect the fungal strands in limestone and chalk rubble walls, and an illuminated magnifier is often a great help. Where it is discovered on a party wall, the other side should always be opened up and examined. Even if nothing is detected on this other side, it should be thoroughly saturated with fungicide and all contacting timber well treated. When satisfied that the full growth has been uncovered and disclosed, all decayed wood should be cut away and burnt immediately. All timber set into an affected wall should be removed, that is, wall-plates, the ends of joists and rafters, lintels, bond timbers, fixing blocks, everything that will rot. There is no need to remove the whole length of a joist or rafter because the end is affected, but it should be cut eighteen inches beyond any visible sign of growth or decay. This does not apply to timbers which are set into the affected wall or contact the wall along their length. They should be entirely removed even if only an inch or two of wood is decayed or has Merulius growth adhering to it. Where this has not been done, the fungus often creeps along the back and emerges several feet away from the treated area. Where the strands have penetrated into brickwork or masonry more than an inch or two, the wall should be taken down. If this is absolutely impossible, then it should be drilled deeply and, if possible from both sides every six inches up and across, to ensure penetration of the fungicide. The brickwork or masonry should be heated with brazing lamps and then brushed to remove the fungal mycelium and strands from the surface. This does not kill the strands which have penetrated more than an inch, but it dries the superficial layer and raises the temperature above that of the surrounding atmosphere and, when it is sprayed, it cools, contracts and tends to take up the fungicide more freely. All surrounding timber which remains should be treated with fungicidal preservative for at least six feet from the limits of the growth, and any replace-
133
THE CARE OF ANTIQUES
ment timber should be thoroughly impregnated, preferably by
pressure or tank immersion.
Where the outbreak has occurred under the floor of a ground floor room, and the soil is contaminated, this should be dug out to a depth of six inches and removed, the new surface sprayed with fungicide and concrete laid to replace the soil. If a concrete sub-floor is already in existence and suspected, it should be blow-lamped and sprayed until saturated. Ground floors affected with Dry Rot are often best replaced with a solid floor of hardcore, concrete and bitumen, with a suitable flooring surface laid on top but, before laying the new floor, be certain that no pieces of wood, affected or otherwise, are buried. I have recently seen Merulius growing in three new pine block floors, laid on pitch and concrete, which had replaced wooden floors rotted away. The architect very wisely specified a solid floor but, in each instance the whole area had not been sterilised and pieces of wood were found in and under the concrete. This is due to lack of knowledge on the part of the builder. Plumbers and electricians are frequently responsible for the development of Dry Rot in houses which show no structural faults or faults in design. They cut pieces of wood out of joists to accommodate their pipes and wires and they let these pieces fall on to damp soil or concrete beneath the ground floor. These chips of wood and the sawdust and shavings which careless and lazy workmen brush through the gaps in floorboards, often act as hosts to fungal growths and start an outbreak which costs the property-owner hundreds of pounds to eradicate.
My advice to anyone who hopes to control fungal rot in buildings is to be absolutely ruthless. Harden your heart and cut out as a surgeon must cut out cancer. Do not leave the smallest morsel or all your efforts may have been wasted.

Round the Antique Shops of England
AS said, this survey must each year be selective, and a cross- section rather than a complete picture, with fresh details to be provided in following issues of our YEAR BOOK. To begin a tour of provincial antique businesses in England is itself a problem, the scope being so wide.
Imagine, however, that a visitor lands at Southampton and desires at once to begin his tour of historic England and satisfy without delay his curiosity about the antique shops. It is suggested that he gets into telephonic communication immediately with Mr. and Mrs. T. H. Campbell-Howes, (Number: Titchfield 54). The result of this call will certainly kill all his birds with one stone, for the Campbell-Howes’ have, at St. Margaret’s Priory near Titchfield (only a few miles from Southampton) not only a fine collection of antiques for sale, but also one of the best settings for the purpose that can be imagined. St. Margaret’s Priory, overlooking and dominating the historic village of Titchfield, is one of the few Elizabethan great houses still left in private hands. The Earl of Southampton of Shakespeare’s Sonnets lived here, “Romeo and Juliet” has its roots in the place, Charles I spent his honeymoon here with Henrietta Maria —and was captured here before Carisbrooke. Each splendid room is kept in beautiful condition and furnished with exactly right period antiques from which the visitor may take his choice. This is not only a valiant venture: it is one of the most remark- able antique businesses in the world.
MAPS
Now use the telephone again and call Mr. P. J. Radford (Fareham 3551). This young connoisseur has recently made a considerable name for himself as a specialist in old maps. On the right, three-quarters of the way through the pleasant town of Fareham, you will see his cream-painted “Raglan House.” Mr. Radford is always glad to show maps of any county or country, and has them priced from as low as 2/-. He has a remarkable collection, and issues a valuable catalogue.

ROUND THE ANTIQUE SHOPS
While in this area, moreover, it is worthwhile visiting South- sea and the fine antique shop at Numbers 67-69 Clarendon Road of Messrs. Edmund Wheeler. (The establishment is two minutes from South Parade Pier.) Specialising in old English furniture (on three floors) the careful proprietors are absolutely reliable, and have enjoyed the patronage of Royalty.
WINCHESTER
It is now suggested that a course should be set straight for Winchester.
Possibly because this is such a fine and historic town with such a plethora of interesting relics, possibly because it is so con- veniently situated for the visitor who arrives at Southampton, Winchester has at the present time almost a record number of really live businesses. First, then, get to Winchester and ask for —Blanchard.
J. Blanchard, Jnr., may well be regarded as the outstanding prov- incial name of his younger generation in antique dealing. He is the type of man whom you know at once to contain the seeds of considerable success in his energetic and decisive manner. This is no mistaken impression, because the young man in question was largely responsible a few years ago for initiating the present world-wide and growing taste for Regency and Empire furniture. He has two establishments, a shop at 48 Jewry Street, and a large Georgian house, Goodworth House, at St. Cross a little way out on the Southampton Road. Visit both, but dwell most on the very tasteful arrangement of the fine Regency furniture at Good- worth House. There are few interiors quite like these to be seen in England today.
Of similar interest is the Winchester firm of Miss Ivy Spicer, long established, and also with two establishments, a large private house at St. Cross nearly opposite Mr. Blanchard’s house, and known as “Redruth,” then a charming shop “The Casket” in Market Street, leading to the Cathedral‘ from the main street of the town. Miss Spicer sells porcelain, the finest furniture, fine paintings (particularly Dutch), and early silver, all items of the first importance and highly recommended.
If, however, you enter Winchester from the Portsmouth road, the conspicuous sign “Antiques” on the right in narrow Chesil Street will direct you most usefully into the neat and careful
175
ROUND THE ANTIQUE SHOPS
galleries of Mr. H. J. Viney, reconstructed with great skill from a very old property, and tastefully stocked with fine old Engiish furniture. Mr. Viney, himself a foremost craftsman, is a dependable authority on walnut particularly, although he also stocks oak: but we do very strongly advise our readers interested in the best walnut furniture at very keen provincial prices not to forget him. He is a very reasonable, first-class dealer.
Entering the town proper now be ready in broad High Street to pause at a large general store on the left known as Cooper Bros. (10 High Street). Do not think this is just a general store, but enter and find—a great gallery stocked with all kinds of fine antiques. Mr. Jack Cooper, assisted by Mrs. Cooper, has long made this department his particular interest and hobby. Possibly there is a larger stock of antique furniture and the like here than anywhere else in the area. Coopers is indeed a surprise of the tour.
Proceed along Market Street and turn right into the thorough- fare known as The Square. Here, at the corner facing you, is a notable firm of silversmiths, Messrs. F. J. Heather & Co., Ltd. Lovers of antique silver will find much to delight them—and also reliability and probity based on one hundred consecutive years of business.
Emerging from this shop you will find nearly opposite the delightful premises of G. H. Bell, the specialist in antique clocks. These are modern premises and yet with the atmosphere of an operatic set for some romantic clockmaker’s dream, with all kinds of long case and bracket and lantern and freak clocks chiming simultaneously and kept in beautiful condition. Mr. Bell is one of the few experts left in the British Isles who can be trusted with the restoration or repair of any kind of antique timepiece. Walk right round the street known as The Square and find finally the shop of Mrs. Ettrick-Welford (Number 22). It is a delight to visit this two-floor establishment wherein the personality of the proprietress and the nature of the stock—much fine porcelain, glass, antique lamp-shades and unusual little pieces of period interest—combine to exercise a charm to be remembered.
Finally in the Square—and just past Mrs. Ettrick-Welford’s establishment—do not omit to call at the fascinating old book- shop of Messrs. Gilbert. This is one of the leading antiquarian

NEWBURY
From Winchester one can strike strategically west to Bourne- mouth, or northwards to Hampshire and London or to Wiltshire. First, it is suggested that the Newbury road north be taken via Whitchurch. Just outside Whitchurch look for a fork to the right sign-posted “‘Kingsclere” and proceed up that fork a short distance to the “Dorset Square Galleries” of Mr. Alfred C. Pembery, an old-established good dealer, who specialises in period panelled rooms, mantelpieces, Chinese wallpaper and works of art. Mr. Pembery has a most interesting stock.
Newbury itself is an outstanding centre for antiques, having three fine firms. Just where the main London road leads out of the town will be found on the left Clarendon House, an old Georgian residence adjoining the equally famous Dower House.
This Clarendon House is the home of one of the leading firms of antique dealers in the provinces, Stuart and Turner Ltd., of which one of the Directors, Mr. Cecil F. Turner, was President
177
ROUND THE ANTIQUE SHOPS
of the British Antique Dealers’ Association in 1933-4 and has been Chairman of the Antique Dealers’ Fair at Grosvenor House; London since its inception. There are extensive and tastefully arranged showrooms, displaying only genuine period antiques and works of art (very high standard), and chosen for design, colour and quality.
Messrs. Stuart and Turner, specialising in oak, walnut and mahogany furniture, display much Regency material also as well as china, glass and silver. They carry out a very considerable amount of interior decoration, and have the highest reputation not only in this country but also in the United States. Every antique sold by them carries a written guarantee as to its period and authenticity.
These remarks similarly apply to the Dower House next door, Messrs. Cliffords’ equally well-known and fine establishment. The premises were formerly “The King’s Arms,” one of the most celebrated posting houses between London and Bath. The present imposing front, considered to be among the _best-balanced examples of simple Georgian architecture extant, was added about

There are no fewer than thirty showrooms at the Dower House, each one furnished according to different periods and boasting innumerable examples of the most beautiful antique furniture of all times.
Lastly, turn back into the town and on the right-hand side of Northbrook Street, main shopping area, find the very popular antique business of Mrs. M. Jarvis, who sells good and a ways authentic furniture, china, glass and the like at popular prices. The charming proprietor of this business has made innumerable friends thanks to her fine taste and fair business dealings. She should always be visited and can invariably produce an item of unusual interest.
HOOK—GODALMING
It is now suggested that to complete a good round trip the car be turned towards Basingstoke and thence to Hook, a village at crossroads where Mr. Beardmore has his Weston Galleries at Crossways Manor, a fine Georgian house, nearly always in the sunshine, containing many showrooms with perhaps the largest stock in the southern counties of walnut furniture, Regency chiffoniers, bookcases, brass inlaid chairs, Knole settees, wing chairs, and pillar diners.
Prices are very keen; and not only original but also restored and reproduction pieces can be bought: other antique dealers are given very liberal terms to trade with Weston Galleries, who are themselves always on the look-out for quality goods to purchase, especially of the Regency period.
Two miles from Hook on the road south is the pleasant village of Odiham, another crossroads centre easily accessible from London, Windsor, Reading, Guildford and Winchester. Here Mr. George W. Phillips has a most comely establishment with outstandingly fine windows, and, within, excellent furniture, Regency to oak. He specialises in beautiful pine fireplaces, being able to offer or procure some to fit any furnishing scheme. This is worth noting.
Now turn towards Guildford, most pleasing town of Surrey, and pause at the foot of the High Street near the bridge over the Wey, where a very fine old business, that of G. Oliver & Sons, is still to be found as it was originally established there as long

ago as 1851. Oliver’s stock probably represents as comprehensive a collection of genuine antiques as will be found in the provinces. Special features are old English furniture, silver and china.
South from Guildford brings the collector to Godalming and yet another prominent name in the Surrey trade—Brooker of Meadrow. The shop will be seen on the left before the town proper is entered, a long, attractive window frontage. Mr. A. J. Brooker is a young man with the modest manner of one who has been trained in the trade from childhood: and the way he is conducting his business is equally modest and effective. He refuses to charge high prices, and maintains a constant flow of business even in difficult times by stocking genuine but average furniture pieces of the kind everybody always wants.
S/A-LIS BURY
So back to Winchester, and, for another day perhaps, a run across to Salisbury, where the outstanding dealer is Mr. Percy H. Bates, at 23 High Street in the centre of the town near the wonderful Cathedral. He is noted for really good quality antique furniture, silver, porcelain and glass.
Then there is Mr. S. C. Scamell at 46 Fisherton Street, who deals in all kinds of antiques but particularly (for the connoisseur) in old weapons. There is another establishment in the pleasant village of Fordingbridge on the road to Bournemouth.
And there is also the firm of Denholm Drew (Ralph Bull), in St. John Street, which stocks French furniture and antique jewellery, but is specially recommended as expert in the lighting of rooms with period settings. They are also very good for antique lamps. : BOURNEMOUTH
So to Bournemouth, and to that fine dealer at Number 8 Lansdowne Road, Mr. Victor Needham. He has the kind of shop where only genuine period furniture and works of art are to be found: reliable, good, interesting.
Recently several new showrooms have been added to the Needham establishment. While there we saw some very valuable Old Masters (one of which is illustrated elsewhere in this book) and we noted with interest that Mr. Needham has a decided leaning towards Worcester porcelain of the Dr. Wall period. This is a dealer heavily starred by our book.

ROUND THE ANTIQUE SHOPS
And the same applies to Mrs. Mary Bellis, who at Number 3 Yelverton Road (a turning to the right as you near the Square) has four storeys filled with priceless early furniture, especially the earliest oak (so difficult to find save in museums).
For anyone thinking of furnishing in this early period styie there are large numbers of ancillary items of contemporary date such as colourful fabrics (velvets, tapestries, needleworks, etc.), and pewter, pictures, Persian rugs and pottery.
In addition there are numerous ecclesiastical pieces (carved
wood groups, figures of Saints, etc.), and a large collection of finely-carved wood and ivory netsukes. Also in the centre of Bournemouth is the chief of the three businesses run by Mr. Cecil Whistance, known as “Arts & Crafts.” Proceed down the Old Christchurch Road from the Lansdowne, and turn left at Horseshoe Common into Fir Vale Road. There, just round the corner on the right, “Arts & Crafts” is to be found: a most intriguing shop with all kinds of objets-d’art both antique and modern, but with a particular accent on the more feminine and French kind of charm and beauty. The shop might be described as a lovely oasis amid the big-town bustle of Bournemouth.
Before leaving Bournemouth a visit is advised to Boscombe, only a mile or two away on the main Christchurch road, where will be found (at Number 844) the antique business of Mr. J. H. Wheatley, an old-established dealer who specialises in fine porce- lain, particularly dessert services, who is good for the U.S. market and who well illustrates the saying that Bournemouth is cheap for antiques.
And in Boscombe do not neglect to visit the Royal Arcade and the bookshop of Messrs. Sidney Wright—that is if you are interested in out of the way, curious old books, and in works on collecting subjects. This is a real treasure house of such reading.
East from Boscombe, in Christchurch and Lymington, are anitque dealers, but this time we must be content to mention only the “Old Smithy” establishment of Mr. Cecil Whistance at Milford-on-Sea. Take the coast road there. It is an interesting run, and Mr. Whistance sells some good antiques, glass and china.
DORCHESTER The main road west from Bournemouth strikes lovely old Dorchester after some 23 miles, and memories of Thomas Hardy

still linger in the quiet town. (We spoke to an “ancient” and he had known Hardy well.)
Dorchester has several good antique shops, but one of them is far more than a shop, being in fact nothing less than the Lodging of Judge Jeffreys when he came to Dorchester for the Bloody Assizes of 1685 after the Monmouth rebellion. Here, at the splendid panelled old house known still as “Judge Jeffreys’ Lodgings” in the main street, Mr. A. M. Willats conducts a famous antique business. Excellent furniture is offered and other items, but the business is particularly worth noting by readers because Mr. Willats is a foremost expert on old English clocks. He has a remarkably fine stock of beautifully preserved examples of the great makers, Tompions, Knibbs and the like, in sound and original condition, and guaranteed to be in good working order. We strongly recommend this business, both for a visit of unique historical interest, and for the aforementioned wonderful display of clocks. If the reader cannot reach Dorchester he is advised to write direct to Mr. Willats, mentioning the ANTIQUES YEAR BOOK, and can be assured of courteous attention.
While in Dorchester it will also be found profitable to visit the two shops of Mr. J. T. Pitman, at 7 Icen Way and 20 High Street. Silver, fine porcelain, and antique furniture, also smaller items, are offered at very reasonable prices.
Similarly in Yeovil a few miles on we find a fine old firm of antique dealers, Edgar Vincent & Son, Middle Street, who go back far in local history, but specialise this time in silver and Sheffield plate, though much good furniture and other antiques are stocked.
EXETER
Some towns, it may already have been observed, are “good for” and others “‘not so good for” antiques. Exeter, with Winchester and a few others, must be heavily starred. First and foremostly, with its most fascinating great windows in the Close facing the Cathedral, is the establishment of ‘“‘Sellicks of Exeter,” one of the great names in the trade, but yet a real antique shop still, for browsing and for searching, and for fortunate finds if ever! In the basement is farmhouse and cottage oak furniture, whilst on
the ground floor are well-filled cabinets displaying fine Chelsea, Always Travel With ANTIQUES YEAR BOOK 189
ROUND THE ANTIOVE SHOPS
Bow, Derby and Oriental porcelain, and even at times the rare Plymouth and Bristol porcelain figures so much sought after by the advanced collector. On the first and second floors is a collection of antique furniture in mahogany and walnut of all periods, and what is possibly the largest stock of tea, dinner and dessert ser- vices in the provinces.
Next proceed round the Cathedral Yard to a splendid Charles II building, decorated with four white urns. Enter an archway and see grouped around the very ancient structure of the Annivellars College (so named after the Cathedral Chantry priests appointed circa 1350, who built their dwelling-houses and refectory there in 1410). This is the home of “Murray’s Antiques,” one of the most sober and reliable firms in the country. In the Refectory and other rooms are displayed choice pieces of Risabedon, Stuart, Queen Anne and Georgian furniture—a wonderful sight. “Murray’s Antiques” is indeed an outstanding business, and is strongly recommended to the visitor, whether from home or overseas.

Before leaving this most perfect of Cathedral closes, moreover, call at the bookshop of Mr. James G. Commin (Number 16). The visitor will find in small compass one of the outstandin antiquarian book stocks in the country—also collecting books all ready to illustrate and explain his antiques.
Inquire next the way to North Street, and find there the firm of F. G. Mansfield & Son, Ltd. Excellent antique furniture is sold by this frm, but the outstanding speciality of Mansfields remains the restoration and repair of antiques. Valuable antiques are sent to them from all parts of the world for renovation. A visit to the long-established workrooms is always encouraged and most instructive.
Quite near to Mansfields, on the right down the hill of Fore Street, will be found yet another kind of large antique business, L. G. Webber .& Son. Established 60 years, Webbers sell all kinds of furniture, and also undertake repairs, but buy so much second- hand material that they always have interesting items for the connoisseur and collector.
Finally note that on the road from Exeter to Exmouth you pass through the ancient town of Topsham, which was at one time a port second only to London. Opposite the old Tudor House in Fore Street you will find a surprise in the fine stock of porcelain figures and other items offered by Gee’s Antique Shop, which is undoubtedly one of the most tasteful establishments of its size in the south-west.
RED CLIFFS AND BLUE SEAS
“In rosy couch upon the seaside hill,” writes the poet of the coast towards Teignmouth from Exeter. It is a lovely journey, and, if the wayfarer pause at the antique shop of Thomas Extence, 2 Wellington Street, Teignmouth, he will merely be passing from one kind of beauty to another. Mr. Extence stocks fine English and Continental porcelain, glass, and interesting small pieces of furniture. With the mind of an artist himself, he has two children both of whom have made names as painters, and one of whom, the son, is also a skilled woodcarver, so that the firm can accept all kinds of difficult restoration work.
Take the Torquay road from Newton Abbot. Pause a mile or two out and ask for Forde House. This will be found on the left,

lying well back in spacious parkland, a magnificent Elizabethan mansion, visited by Charles I in 1625, and the first lodging place of William of Orange when he landed in Tor Bay, 1688. Mrs. M. Sellick, who might be described as “mother” of the famous Exeter antique firm, preserves Forde House today as a home of antiques for sale. If you visit the House you can also have tea there, and walk among rooms furnished just as they were when William with his gay entourage also entered.
After which it is well worth running into Torquay, loveliest of English seaside cities, and turning past the Clock Tower at the picturesque Harbour to find the up at Number 12 Victoria Parade of Messrs. C. & D. O’Donoghue, established since 1870 as first-class dealers in English and Oriental china, silver, Sheffield plate, and old English furniture. This is an excellent business, and the old porcelain offered is well worth the attention of the connoisseur.
The same applies to another starred firm on this route, that of Mr. W. J. Courtney Beer, occupying a lovely building (beauti- fully restored after tragic war damage) at 48 Fore Street, Brixham, most charming of old fishing ports. Mr. Beer sells, at really low

W: EzS TW ASR DH Ow
This year, because of space considerations, it is not possible to treat in detail of Cornwall, but a skeleton journey will be provided, starting at the two businesses in Plymouth of Mr. A. V. H. Gamble, a young man who has been trained from childhood in his subject, and sells at Number 24 New Street, Barbican, and at Number 51 Union Street, Stonehouse, a great deal of fine furniture, porcelain and glass. The business is known as “Alvins.” It has been honoured by Royal patronage.
The straight run from Plymouth to St. Austell in Cornwall entails a complete change of topographical scene, but not neces- sarily of antique interest, as the ancient Duchy can boast several first-class dealers, foremost among whom is Mr. J. Morland Coon, at 4 Market Street, St. Austell. You will find the shop opposite the church and convenient car park. Three generations of Mr. Morland Coon’s family are still engaged in purveying fine furniture (accent on Georgian), porcelain, silver, Sheffield plate, glass, pewter, and, indeed, all classes of antiques. This is a sober, reliable business, to be recommended. The same applies to a very notable establishment at Truro (most convenient town for reach- ing other Cornish By al spots) known as The Antique Galleries. Conducted by Mr. Michael Chesterman, the Galleries occupy an elegant Georgian house at 20 Lemon Street, the thoroughfare leading out to Falmouth. The specialities are general antiques
After which proceed to Falmouth, quaint port, where there is an old-established antique business known as John Maggs, in narrow Church Street. The lovely Georgian bow-front premises have been scheduled as a building of historic and architectural interest. Inside, collected over a period of fifty years, are fine stocks of furniture, porcelain, prints and glass.
Finally in Penzance we must mention the firm of H. M. Ameye and Sons. Turn down by the side of the Star Hotel in Market Jew Street, and, at the Sign of the Shield, call on this good Cornish business, for antique furniture, china and glass, Oriental carpets and works of art. Also, enlist their services if you require really expert restoration work done, polishing and the like.
196
ROUND “THE: ANTIOUER SHOPS
Do not forget that in North Devon, at Barnstaple and Bideford. there are some good dealers. We would ourselves draw special attention this time to Mr. M. Denny’s very attractive shop in the narrow lane known as Parish Churchyard, Barnstaple. Mr. Denny sells a wide variety of antiques; also he is a really skilled restorer.
The journey into Somerset from North Devon may be con- veniently halted at the favoured resort of Minehead, specifically at two antique shops, The Old Curiosity Shop of young Mr. John T. White, 6a The Parade—right in the centre of the town— where all kinds of interesting small articles in porcelain, glass, silver, copper, brass and pewter may be found, and the establish- ment of Messrs. Cracknell and Roberts at 19 Friday Street (under an archway). Cracknell and Roberts are also West of England craftsmen who can undertake all classes of restoring from any distance, but they have a fine large showroom of excellent antique furniture at reasonable, country prices.
On the way to Bridgwater now do not forget to pause at the little village of Cannington and inspect the antique shop therein of Mr. F. Harding, who operates from headquarters at 28 High Street, Bridgwater, where his stock is varied (from warming-pans to fine furniture) and very satisfying to those who are always looking for the romantic antique shops usually found only in fiction.
BATH AND WEST
Bath might be described as in itself the largest antique business in the world. Certainly it possesses some famous and good dealers, not only in general antiques but also in such specialities as silver. Call, for example, at the shop of Mr. Charles T. Gilmer, 16 Old Bond Street, readily identifiable by its very attractive bow-front.

Late of Mallett and Son, Mr. Gilmer is a silversmith of dis- tinction, who also sells fine jewels and many small antique items. Then proceed dawn to 13 Old Bond Street and find the excellent antique furniture business of Mr. Andrew Dando. He occupies an 18th century building in one of the oldest parts of Bath, and sells only fine old English furniture, English and Oriental por- celain, silver and the like, to be regarded very much as a West Country aristocrat of the ‘rade.

In addition there are several older dealers and some interesting younger ones, among whom can be specially recommended Mr. J. R. Hall, whose shop will be found at 16 Pierrepont Street, one minute from Parade Gardens, with an interesting selection of furniture, china and glass, but in particular—tfurniture, of which Mr. Hall has family experience behind him.
Then in Broad Street, at the top end of a famous antiques thoroughfare, will be found Georgian Antiques (Number 21), the proprietor of which, Mr. Lake, is a young and enterprising dealer with a considerable future, who is always busy, reasonable, and good for mahogany, Welsh oak, and inexpensive chandeliers.
Now ask your way to the famous old Theatre Royal and the home of Beau Nash, to find three very interesting new dealers. The first, at Number 11 St. John’s Place, is “The Chatelaine,” charming with porcelain, pottery and objets d’art; the second a few doors up the street and named Number One Beaufort

J. Symes, recently transferred from Bristol, and very good for silver, china and period furniture: a sound dealer whose prices are extremely reasonable.
In the vicinity of Bath is situated the village of Castle Combe, which can be reached by the Chippenham Road. Without a doubt it is one of the two or three most beautiful villages in England, completely secluded, a single unit of beauty in uniform, weathered stone. Mrs. J. M. Watson has a charmingly-arranged cottage therein with a display of lovely antiques at very reasonable prices.
BBebS TO
After which—Bristol. If you go to the Clifton district and ask for The Mall, you will find therein the antique galleries of Messrs. Hall and Rohan, and will find all you need in antiques for one town. Mr. Hall is a young and enterprising man. Mr. Rohan bears a famous name in antiques, as his father was the distinguished Thomas Rohan of Haslemere and Bournemouth, reputed original of Vachell’s “Quinneys.” The premises of this firm are fine, and the stock ranges over all classes of antiques, though there is a leaning towards fine furniture and _ glass.
Then in Bristol, do not forget Christmas steps. This was traditionally the haunt of antique dealers. It is worth visiting today for the shop of Mr. Herbert W. Smith (Number 7), which teems with fine porcelain, glass, silver and other items. This, indeed, is the kind of shop that the experienced buyer values, with a constantly changing stock, skilled management, and a

very high standard of commercial morality. Mr. Smith is always glad to purchase antique jewellery and the like.
Next stop now may well be the stately old Cotswold Town of Cirencester—specially advised because it contains the long- established antiques business of Edmund C. Legg and Son, who may be relied upon to offer only the most authentic early English furniture, English and Irish glass, also rare keyboard instruments.
After which take the Gloucester Road, and just as you leave the town look on the left for the Corinium (Roman name of Cirencester) Cabinet Shop of Mr. F. E. Blowing, who is not only the finest furniture restorer of these parts, but also a dealer in interesting old furniture.
Now to Gloucester, chiefly notable today for the splendid Cathedral, and, in College Street leading thereto, the Cathedral Galleries of Mr. and Mrs. Frith. All kinds of antiques are sold, but very attractive specialities are Gloucestershire topographical and genealogical items of all kinds—and glass, and silver
(especially early English spoons). HERE BE PRINCES
As said before, the antiques map of England varies very much in its shading. Who would expect, on entering the quiet little country town of Tewkesbury, celebrated in literature from Hazlitt and “John Halifax Gentleman” to Mr. John Moore’s modern accounts—who would expect to find therein a foremost dealer in old English porcelain?
This is Mr. T. Leonard Crow, whose Ceramic Galleries at 10 Church Street are exquisitely stocked with rare and lovely speci- mens of Worcester, Bow, Chelsea, all the great names, also with some very fine silver. Mr. Crow undertakes commissions for connoisseurs. He supplied the lovely old Worcester dessert service which was Cheltenham’s wedding gift to H.R.H. Princess Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh.
Princes, indeed—for in Cheltenham a few miles away will be found two famous specialists in antique silver, Messrs. Martin and Co. Ltd., prominently situated at the beginning of the fine Promenade on a corner position, and Mr. Eric Scott Cooper at Number 52 on this thoroughfare which has few equals for beauty in the world. Mr. Scott Cooper is worth visiting not only for

silver but also for Sheffield plate, antique jewellery, Battersea enamels, and, in fact, for objets d’art et vertu generally. The personal touch in this business is very noticeable, and Mr.. Scott
Cooper is both skilled in his trade and helpful.
The firm of Martin and Co. itself was founded as long ago as 1806 by a Mr. Martin, and bought in 1889 by Alderman G. Dimmer, J.P., C.C., the owner of similar businesses in Southsea and Liverpool. On his death in 1927 he was succeeded by his son Mr. L. G. Dimmer, and his grandson, Mr. M. A. Dimmer is now on the Board of Directors. The Dimmers have made of this business an establishment of Bond Street standard which always carries a large stock of antique silver, early Chinese jade and objets d’art, including pieces by Paul Lamerie, Peter Archambo, Eben Coker, the Hennells, Hester Bateman, and other famous silversmiths.
How pleasant to drive a fine car under the spreading trees down the Cheltenham Promenade to the elegance of the Rotunda and Montpellier Walk, where, at Number 22, is found the dainty shop of Georgina Ashwell! She sells a wide variety of the most

COTSWOLDS
From Cheltenham it is pleasant to journey along the edge of the Cotswolds and through the Vale of Evesham to the show village of Broadway and then to stately Chipping Campden. Here the visitor who wants at once to learn something on the spot of England’s past and at the same time to a antiques, can achieve both desires by visiting Woolstaplers’ Hall, the ancient meeting place of the merchants whose prosperity built these loveliest of old English towns. Mr. and Mrs. Pritchard run a fine antiques business at Woolstaplers’ Hall, and those who do not find what they require there may visit also a branch of the business in Broadway, the shop of “Christie” in that companion village.
Broadway, most popular and remarkable village of all the lovely Cotswolds, has also the outstandingly famous establish- ment of Mr. H. W. Keil. This “Tudor House,” a splendid

Mr. Keil is among the he dealers, with very high standards. 17th and 18th century
rniture is his speciality, but he also sells much else, such as panelling, silver, armour and weapons.
Continue two-and-a-half miles from Chipping Campden on the Mickleton Road, and pause at an attractive old house on the left-hand side with the sign “Antiques” prominently displayed. This is Nineveh Farm, where Mrs. M. E. Bayliss and Mr. F. H. Sharp sell much fine early period oak and other furniture, antique clocks, pewter and the like. A very pleasant reception is arsured visitors, who are under no obligation to purchase, but will probably do so when they note the low prices of the articles for sale. To return across the heart of the Cotswolds now vwza various beautiful little towns of the region to real town life again and Oxford will be a delectable experience. Aim, for instance, at Stow-on-the-Wold and pause at the Cotswold House of Mr. T. Pritchard. Part of this establishment has been converted by the proprietor into a museum of articles used locally and traditionally in crafts and in agriculture. The antique business proper can offer many such relics for sale, and this is a unique opportunity to acquire very genuine articles. Or tarry a while in Bourton-on-the-Water, a gem of unspoilt architecture, with elegant stone bridges across an ever-present brook that babbles through the streets. Here Mrs. D. J. Dawkes, at Portland House, specialises'in old English china and figures, glass, Oriental porcelain, brass and copper. The house is over 300 years old. There is a charming tea room at the back, transformed by Mrs. Dawkes’ artist husband into a miniature hall of ancient times complete with minstrel gallery.
MALVERN — WORCESTER
Retracing our steps a little we could have alternatively proceeded from Tewkesbury to Malvern and Worcester, a slight deviation being worthwhile not only because the hills present such a fine and unusual spectacle, but also because the town has a very pleasant and long-established antique dealer, Miss M. W. Price. If you come in by the main road you will find her place, Holland Cottage, on the right at the foot of Church

After which ancient Worcester is reached, and another splendid Cathedral attained, opposite which Mr. A. J. Philpott has his good antique business at Number 4, College Street. He specialises in walnut furniture, clocks and porcelain—with a particular interest in scale-blue Worcester, as is right and proper considering that the famous Works is situated nearby. (You can visit it.)
Then an interesting Worcester personality of the new genera- tion is Mr. Thomas Tolley, who has a little shop for the sale of interesting objets d’art at Number 46 Sidbury, and who is also a picture restorer of considerable reputation.

business of Mr. T. Wyatt, a dealer with 50 years’ experience, who sells particularly furniture, Oriental and English porcelain, Staffordshire pottery, silver, needlework, tapestries and ironwork.
WOLVERHAMPTON
It is well worthwhile running straight to Wolverhampton, then proceeding from Queen’s Square at the centre of the town down Darlington Street. At the foot of the incline, turning right, is the district known as Chapel Ash, and here are the antique dealers, firstly, no less an authority on Staffordshire and Ralph Wood than Mr. E. J. Morris, who runs a first-class antique business that is among the oldest in existence (the first Morris established it in the year of Waterloo!) His pottery is famous. You can write to Morris from any part of the world and be assured of fair and courteous dealing from a man who has grown up in and of Staffordshire (some of those Ralph Wood figures, ah, the greens and blues and the sturdiness withal!) and if you visit the shop, it has floor after unpretentious floor and great back barns of furniture,
early oak, other pieces of all periods.
Then proceed a little further down Chapel Ash and on the right still will be found “The Little Gallery,” another of the shops of Mr. Cecil Whistance of Bournemouth. It has a uniquely small frontage, but fine Gallery rooms upstairs with antiques, period furnishings, and products of local artists and craftsmen.
POTTERIES — BUXTON
It may well pay the visitor at this point—especially the overseas visitor—to proceed to the Potteries, those five towns of ceramic fame which are almost an aesthetic spectacle in themselves, compact of ovens and smoke-stacks. In the best of the five towns, Hanley, Mrs. Broughton-Thompson does a lively trade with the United States from her shop “The Antique Box,” 49 Piccadilly, and always has some interesting local pieces to show.
Whence the run to Buxton, famous spa of Derbyshire, may be advised both as a means of secing some magnificent scenery from a good but little-used road, and also for the purpose of visiting three first-class antique dealers, Mrs. A. Hockenhull at 6, Cavendish Circus, and Messrs. Walter Salt, 42 High Street, and Plant and Sons, 6 Hall Bank. All three specialise in trade business; and Buxton should certainly not be omitted as a centre for antiques.
213
ROUND THE ANTIQUE SHOPS
BIRMINGHAM
Over now to where great Birmingham sprawls across all roads, a city that must be approached very carefully for antiques purposes, two dealers being in the present case singled out as outstanding.
The first is the firm of A. T. Silvester and Sons, whose main premises are at Numbers 666-672 Warwick Road, Solihull, on the main road into Birmingham from Warwick, and easily reached from Coventry—Birmingham or the  Stratford-on-Avon— Birmingham roads. Good furnishing and other antiques are offered here at very competitive provincial prices. The stock is large and Messrs. Silvester will have almost anything you ask for, not only furniture but also porcelain, silver, glass and clocks. This firm is strongly recommended to the ordinary purchaser of antiques, for whom it caters very carefully. There is an interesting
branch at Coleshill.
The second Birmingham dealer to be particularised this time has premises at Number 152 Alcester Road, Moseley (the Stratford-on-Avon-Birmingham road _ passes through _ this

suburb), and, under the name Abbot and Attwood Antiques, makes an outstanding speciality of Welsh oak—unusual, and to be carefully noted—accompanied by genuine old pewter, brass and copper, as well as porcelain and pottery. Do not forget: Abbot and Attwood, Moseley, for Welsh dressers.
While in the Birmingham area, however, or if you have to travel north on the Lichfield road, it is a good idea to make a careful note of Sutton Coldfield, and, as you enter that town, look for the word “Antiques” which hangs outside historic Vesey Manor on the left. This establishment, carefully restored by Mr. and Mrs. T. W. Coulborn, sells good antique furniture, porcelain and the like, and may be specially recommended to those who wish to furnish their homes not too expensively with very attractive antiques. The house dates back to around 1450. It might be noted that the Coulborns are always interested to buy small pieces of porcelain.
Then proceed through Sutton Coldfield, and, just leaving the town centre look on the right for the galleries, at Numbers 30a and 30b High Street, of the artist Mr. Norman H. English. Here are modern -pictures—but also, for those who enter and browse around, many small antique pieces for the collector in china, pewter and brass. A speciality is the correct framing of period paintings and prints in a style suitable to the age and subject.
SHAKESPEARE
Next call is—and certainly should be—Stratford-on-Avon, which might be coupled with Edinburgh as one of the two cleverest towns in the British Isles: a community which is outstandingly prosperous because it deliberately caters for the

visitor (who, by the way, likes to be catered for). In Stratford you will go at once to the “Birthplace,” and in Henley Street opposite this (where Shakespeare’s father got fined for keeping his dungheap) you will discover the local branch of a fine antique business, Mr. Grainger-Brown’s of Warwick. The silver and Sheffield plate will particularly attract the discriminating collector, although much else is sold.
Now turn to the left and perceive at the end of Henley Street a bold sign “Antiques,” and know that there awaits Mr. John Wigington, a very enterprising young dealer who is also one of our outstanding authorities on antique weapons, possessing a veritable armoury of interest, part of which he has recently transferred to a remarkable Museum at Poet’s Arbor (opposite ae General Post Office), Sheep Street. Not only are there weapons in the Museum, but also the largest oak refectory table in the world, a famous Shakespearean bust, and some very fine Old Masters (Gainsborough, Reynolds, Kneller, Wouverman, etc.). Back at the shop in Henley Street Mr. Wigington also sells antique furniture, pictures, silver and china.

So to Warwick as next stop, with two excellent dealers, the Mr. C. Grainger-Brown already mentioned for Stratford, and Messrs. Quinneys, who will be found by turning in the middle of the High Street up the quiet thoroughfare of Church Street leading to the renowned St. Mary’s Church with its exquisite ae Chapel. Opposite at Number 9, Mr. A. G. Robinson and his son sell English and French furniture, as well as porce- lain, pottery, paintings and clocks. They have a fine collection of silver, and, rare speciality, antique barometers (which they

Number 7 High Street.
At the corner of Church Street is Mr. Grainger-Brown’s shop, always being visited by discerning overseas visitors and English collectors who are invariably satisfied with their finds of good furniture, china, glass, needlework, antique jewellery, Sheffield plate and silver. Down a narrow turning opposite towards the redoubtable Castle wall is Oken’s House, an ancient structure preserved by Mr. Grainger-Brown for the exhibition of still more mouth-watering antiquities. Yes, Warwick is a star town.
“Sit RL EAY"=-B BO WwW
The writer of these notes now had a memorable experience in this area. He had heard of a very well-known old British Antique Dealers’ Association member who lived at Tredington, a few miles north of Shipston-on-Stour on the main London-Stratford-on- Avon road. He turned the Morris Oxford curiously in this direction, came to the village and was just driving on when he noticed on the right down a side road what appeared to be a finely-restored Cotswold house, with the sign “Antiques.” He called—and found that Mr. J. H. Brown and his son were the people he had been looking for, and, they had recently built this house themselves, lovingly to the plans of a lifetime. The place is really worth visiting. Mr. Brown specialises in trade business, furniture, glass, china, old ironwork and garden ornaments, and has excellent showrooms at the back.
And a note for those in this area, or, indeed, anywhere in the British Isles, who require restoration of antique furniture done by a genuine, independent craftsman. Mr. Christopher Wastie, of Knave’s Knoll, Charlbury, nr. Oxford, wrote to us that he “was indentured to cabinet making (in the sum of £40) by my father 25 years ago at the age of 14, and wood is almost a religion to me.” At a time when craftsmen of this kind are hard to find it should be worth noting that Mr. Wastie is open to accept commissions of any kind from any distance.

THAME
After which—Thame. The village is a few miles from Oxford, and can be visited on the way to London or Oxford, by a short deviation to the north. Thame is a pleasant small town or village in a district where collectors abound, and so it possesses several really good dealers, such as the “Witch Ball,” a beautiful shop with a large witch ball hanging outside as a sign, centre of the town at Number 2 Corn Market.
Here Mr. and Mrs. T. Evelyn Swain specialise memorably in the provision of old pieces for old houses (as they would them- selves put it). The exterior facade of this shop—used on the jacket of our YEAR BOOK by kind permission—is a model for modern antique businesses, decorated in exquisite taste. The interior more than fulfils that promise, and the stock, with much of the better kind of cottage furniture, is designed to please all kinds of purchaser.
But Thame has a very old business—one of the oldest in the country—and one that specialises outstandingly in a characteristic item of local furniture, the Windsor chair. This is the firm of George Newitt, further up the High Street on the other side. The present energetic proprietor, Mr. Peter Newitt, a personality always to be remembered, has perhaps the finest private collection of Windsors ever seen by the writer of these notes. Also he sells all kinds of fine furniture at reasonable prices: and there is something so attractive about his business that once we encountered half-a-dozen of our leading film actors assembled there.
And before leaving Thame do not forget to call at the premises of Arts Ltd., further down on the left at Number 23a High Street, because this fine restorer of furniture also specialises in the repair and reproductions of period mercury barometers, as well as clocks.
OXFORD AND THAME
You may come into Oxford by the Woodstock Road. If so you will find Little Clarendon Street as a narrow turning on the right just before the busy centre of the town is reached. At Numbers 1, 2 and 7, Messrs. H. W. Jones & Son conduct a famous old antique business, primarily in furniture, silver, china and works of art. They are known to generations of undergraduates, and, by their reliability, count many heads of colleges and other distinguished persons among their customers.

ROUND THE ANTIQUE SHOPS
Outstanding also in the antiques world of Oxford is the person- ality of Mr. A. H. Goodban. He trades under the name of “Hallidays” at 86-87 High Street, mainly in fine old English furniture at that address. Under the name of “The Antiquary” at 50 St. Giles Street he offers antique silver and porcelain. These are both very flourishing businesses, built up by skill, probity and a flair for the discovery of antique rarities in which all can share. Mr. Goodban can offer unique facilities for repairs and restorauons.
THAMES “VA LL EY
Next starred town along the road is Wallingford, where a great stone Thames bridge links Berkshire with Oxfordshire, and where the inhabitants take due pride in the fact that they possess the oldest Charter in England, date 1155. Near the bridge, in one of the finest brickwork houses of the Royal County, Messrs. Summers, Davis and Son have a well-varied display of antiques, where a motto of “lovely furnishings for lovely homes” might well be justified. Cars are nearly always palling up at this deservedly-favoured dealer.
Afterwards comes lovely Henley-on-Thames, wherein the starred dealer is tiadobted| Adam House Ltd., 71 Bell Street, in the centre of the town on the main Oxford-London road. This is a wonderful old Georgian building, which provides an ideal setting and accommodation for fine period furniture and decora- tive porcelain of the late 18th century and the Regency periods. Mr. Douglas Clark, one of the directors, was long associated with various London houses, and has considerable knowledge which he is always willing to place at the disposal of those who call on him, the aim of the business being to sell at very reasonable prices goods which are yet authentic and perfect of their type.
Now proceed—if you are well-advised—straight to Marlow, yet another jewel among towns of the Thames Valley, and make sure to visit at The Old Vicarage in the centre of the High Street a very well-known antique dealer, Mr. C. Toller, who sells furniture (good oak), china and glass, but has three interesting specialities, namely children’s antique furniture, treen, and vest- ments.
Marlow also has, among smaller shops, one of much interest, that opened since the war by Mr. Victor Bishop, a young man * with wide trade experience and a flair for buying good porcelain
225
ROUND THE ANTIQUE SHOPS
and arranging it tastefully for sale. His premises, 8-10 West Street, occupy a fine old building opposite the Obelisk at the centre of the town, and, apart from the rare porcelain, Georgian silver is sold therein. ‘
HIGH WYCOMBE
It is a pleasant run from Marlow over to the main London road at High Wycombe—we wondered how the Morris Oxford would take us down that steepest of long hills into the town but the brakes held so smoothly that we were scarcely conscious of the grave descent—and the journey is again worth making: because of Turner and Bassetsbury Lane Mill.
Turn right at the bottom of the hill and proceed along the London road for nearly a mile, pass the Cricket Ground bus stop on the right, then be very careful not to miss Bassetsbury Lane, a turning on the right. The Mill is a step down the lane at the bottom, and is worth visiting for its architectural interest alone, being a fine old specimen of a water-driven flour-mill, with much of the apparatus preserved. Bassetsbury Manor itself is mentioned in Domesday Book, and the 16th century, half-timbered mill is

scheduled as an Ancient Monument. The three capacious floors with gigantic beams and good oak boards carry what must be the most extensive stock of antiques in these parts, every kind of period furniture but only genuine pieces, very moderate prices, and many sidelines in which Mr. G. A. Turner specialises such as pewter and horse-brasses (what an array around that top floor, grey and gold and brown, like a cinema set!)
Now turn round and proceed to West Wycombe, beautiful village at the western end of High Wycombe, where Miss Irene Donald sells English and Continental furniture, porcelain, pottery, glass and bric-a-brac both to a steady stream of passing visitors—who would like to pause in any case at the attractive old tea rooms—and to discerning trade buyers. The establishment is known as the Apple Orchard, and there is a subsidiary shop at the other side of the road.
Many good antique shops are to be found along the main roads which approach London, as at Beaconsfield, where Mr. H. L. Brown (“Louis Brown’”’) at 26 High Street, on the right-hand side past the Cross, conducts one of the oldest-established businesses of these parts, with a fine name, and great knowledge of his speciality, old English furniture. And, nearly opposite this est- ablishment, but with the address 43-45 London End, are the generous showrooms of Mrs. Florence Helen Wood, a lady of much charm and ability with important connections on the other side of the Atlantic, where her husband is also an antique dealer. Mrs. Wood has furnished some of her rooms with antiques exactly as they should be under domestic conditions. She sells fine furniture, china, glass and works of art generally.
GOOD HUNTING-GROUNDS
Then for surprise. Uxbridge, next on the road, is a busy town, but possesses an antique shop that many a storied cathedral city might envy. This is the establishment of Mr. H. R. S. Turner, which you find in Cross Street, an oasis by an old churchyard reached by a side turning from the main street as you pass through. The premises were formerly the historic “Catherine Wheel” Hostelry, of fifteenth century origin, and you can see at the back the original stone sign of the “Wheel.” Mr. Turner has converted quaint old rooms into beautitul, intimate abodes for his lovely stock-in-trade.

ROUND THE ANTIQUE SHOPS
After which run down to the charming village of Colnbrook, wherein will be found prominently the bright and immaculate premises of Mr. Richard J. Piner, a young man who combines energy with a wealth of inherited trade knowledge. He always has several of the small pieces which are so hard to find nowadays, and he presents them in mint condition. Our call was in the off-season, but customers drove up every ten minutes and bought. (Colnbrook, by the way, is only a mile or two from London Airport).
Alternatively one can travel into London via Tring and Amersham. We would suggest a run out from Town to, say, Stratford-on-Avon, via these good antiques centres, starting at Rickmansworth, which has an excellent dealer, W. & D. Bruton, at Number 125 half way along the High Street on the left. The stock comprises furniture, glass, copper, pewter and the like, but Mr. Bruton’s personal interest is porcelain, especially Worcester of the Dr. Wall period; and some interesting pieces of this and other schools are always to be seen.
After which there is a pleasant run to Amersham and the famous “Mill Stream” of Captain Vyse Millard, a fine old mill on the right just before you enter the village, which serves both as a series of showrooms for antique furniture and as a very well- run restaurant. The mill house is worth seeing for itself, a grand old specimen of its fast-dwindling kind. As for Captain Millard’s antiques, they are sufficiently well known to connoisseurs to need no bush. A speciality is the small piece in walnut or mahogany, with frequently a very rare example indeed. This is a star port of call.
TRING
Next we reach Tring, a very pleasant little town in a most unusual part of Buckinghamshire, always worth a visit for the scenic interest alone. And for over half a century monosyllabic Tring, for lovers of antiques, has been associated with the sey terse name Bly, of which today there are two representatives eac with a notable business, though both are different and need not be regarded as competitors. John Bly of Tring has his premises at 50 High Street, in the centre of the town; F. S. Bly is equally well-known (with his good wife) for his establishment ““The Corner Cupboard,” Brook Street, which is to be seen on the right as you come to the town down the London Road.
229
ROUND THE ANTIQUE SHOPS
Do not think, however, that “The Corner Cupboard” is in any way small or just an old curiosity shop. Ask to be shown the great barn at the side with its huge stock of all kinds of antique furniture. Explore the premises at the rear with their wealth of interest in the form of garden ornaments, sundials, lead tanks. Mr. F. S. Bly is a specialist in these lines; while in his main shop will be found small pieces of all kinds in the untouched con- dition beloved of discerning collectors.
Similarly Mr. John Bly’s showrooms at 50 High Street are far more extensive than would appear from the road. Possibly they are the largest in these parts, with a floor space of over 3,500 square feet. Here the object is to specialise chiefly in the very best kind of eighteenth and early nineteenth century furniture, and Mr. John Bly himself deserves to be regarded as a leading expert on mahogany, which is his great interest. Everything is in splendid condition, and the front shop is among the most delight- ful of its kind in the country. Do not omit to visit this establish- ment if you are interseted in small mahogany pieces—the most sought-after in the antiques.world today.

SU eC OA SE
To cover the south coast and Kent it might now be suggested that a quick trip be made to Brighton and Hove, wherein will be found a great number of antique shops—so many of the smaller kind, in fact, that no attempt will be made this year to describe them in detail.
While in Hove, however, a beeline should certainly be made for the shop known as “The Cabinet’”’ at Number 156 Portland Road, opposite St. Peter’s Catholic Church in a long wide road with no parking worries. Mr. and Mrs. Towner, the proprietors, have a truly interesting array of choice porcelain, especially ser- vices (in which they specialise). We were particularly impressed by a superb Derby dish, circa 1790, the work of Billingsley.
Then—as another taster—proceed to Number 15c Prince Albert Street, Brighton, edge of the famous “Lanes” area, where Mary Russell sells in particular old English pottery, specialising in this item most carefully. Trade inquiries are invited and it will be found that unusual pieces of unusual wares can often be offered or procured.

ROUND ‘THE ANTIQUE SHOPS
After which the Lanes, Number 9 Union Street, reveal the shop of Mr. Samuel Ross, who again specialises in pottery, but also fine porcelain of all schools. This keen dealer of the younger school brings taste and acumen to an elderly area, and is similarly recommended for trade or postal inquiries.
COASTAL ROAD
Proceeding eastwards from Brighton along the spectacular coastal road and the white cliffs, the traveller reaches old Seaford, snug little seaside town which has at The Old House, High Street, a most interesting and enterprising general antique business, with 16 showrooms, and everything from porcelain to ship’s models, fine furniture to silhouettes, pewter to miniatures.
Eastbourne lies next across the road, with several antique businesses. The town, again, is one of the few that cannot be dealt with properly this year, and we must confine ourselves to suggesting that a call be made at the firm of Seldon’s, 40 Grove Road, which is reached by turning right from the main Terminus Road at the station. This keen business sells antique furniture, but prefers porcelain, glass and pictures. The management is
helpful and very alive.
After which we may proceed at once to a real high-spot of this tour, The Old Mint House at Pevensey. Half-way between East- bourne and Bexhill lies this quaint town of the Conqueror and successive Norman kings. Messrs. C. Allen & Sons have taken one of the most ancient habitations therein, the 600-year-old Mint House (right at the centre, opposite the Castle) and con- verted it into a series of showrooms for antiques. There are in all no fewer than 28 rooms, all rich in oak beams of good preserva- tion, and with much fine panelling. King Edward VI stayed here; the site of the house returns to 1076 A.D.; many romantic stories are connected with the place, and there is at least one near-authentic ghost and a room that feels haunted. To see the antiques (much genuine oak) in these proper surroundings is a most satisfying experience. Messrs. Allen have a very large collection, and their prices are reasonable.
When you arrive at the pleasant resort of Bexhill-on-Sea you will find in Sackville Road at the Pevensey end of the town an establishment known as Mayfair Antiques (Number 37). Mr. P. E. Heathcote, the proprietor, is a Londoner and a most know- ledgable dealer of the younger generation who has acquired his

knowledge in a family long connected with the trade. His pleasant personality and flair for acquiring genuine and fine antiques attract to his shop customers who seldom go away disappointed. One is surprised in this small town to find such a fine collection of porcelain as Mr. Heathcote can show, and, for another example, so many small chests of the kind which are rare enough elsewhere. But this mood of surprise is extended still further when one proceeds to St. Leonard’s Road, farther on through the town, and enters the shop of Mr. Stanley Courtenay (the oldest- established here, and with a packed storehouse opposite). Mr. Courtenay is a very good dealer who sells furniture, porcelain and glass. He has three showrooms and a fine reputation in these parts. Also he is a very charming and knowledgeable mentor.
But Bexhill is indeed an astonishing town. Proceed a little further up St. Leonard’s Road, to Number 13 and the severely- tasteful establishment of Mr. Malcolm Anderson.
Always Travel With ANTIQUES YEAR BOOK 234
ROUND THE ANTIQUE SHOPS
One might almost be in Davies Street, W.1., for Mr. Anderson sells only old prints, such as aquatints and mezzotints in colour, and rare Chinese works of art, such as porcelain, carved ivories, lacquer work, tortoiseshell, jade and amber, silk and drawn thread work. Recently Mr. Anderson held an Exhibition of Chinese blue and white porcelain. His gallery of sporting prints makes the most pernickety collector feel at home. Bexhill is certainly a remarkable little town. . . . This view receives final confirmation when the visitor proceeds a little further up St. Leonard’s Road to the antique shop of Mr. Bradley Thorpe. Here are charming people who sell good antique furniture, silver, porcelain, glass. This is a very pleasant antique business, yet with an air of dis- tinction, and the stock is always interesting.
BEESON--AND HASTINGS
The great promenade of St. Leonard’s runs along the sparkling sea to Hastings proper. Halfway along, in a beautiful shop at Number 13 Marine Court, a large block of flats, is the exquisite stock-in-trade of Mr. Rimington Beeson. This consists largely of unusual items of porcelain and pottery (Meissen and the other Continentals well-represented), good clocks, fine glasses, genuine old paperweights, and—chess-men. Mr. Beeson has a big future as a specialist dealer in these items, possessing fine taste and an attractive stock always He is open to buy as well as sell, and cannot be too strongly recommended.
In Hastings we can similarly recommend this year an old- young firm in the High Street antiques quarter known as J Palser and Sons (Number 35). Here Mr. A. W. Tomkins sells interesting pieces of furniture of the 18th century as well as English and Continental porcelain and pottery. (He is, by the way, particularly interested in faience.)
Coupled with this we strongly recommend also a visit to the firm of Fine Arts, Ltd., at Number 78 High Street. The pro- prietor is very knowledgeable and helpful. His stock always contains items of interest to the small as well as the large collector. Much genuine oak is available, chief native furniture of this old Sussex. A very pleasant and helpful young firm .. .

Afterwards, it is recommended that a call be made at “The Sea Chest,” 41 High Street, Sandgate, on the way into Folkestone. Here, Mr. R. McCausland-White has a branch of his Lavenham, Suffolk, business, selling English and Continental porcelain and pottery, furniture, paintings and prints. Mr. McCausland-White is an artist and student of history with the knowledge that leads to good buying, and consequently does much wholesale and over- seas business, in future to be directed from Lavenham, in Suffolk.

Canterbury, historic centre of Kent, with the Cathedral and other antiquities, has some good dealers, such as Mr. F. A. Matthews, who will be found at Number 25 St. Margaret’s Street, a turning to the left in the centre of the High Street if you come in from Folkestone. This is pre-eminently a fine furniture dealer of long experience, who also sells china, glass and antique carpets and fabrics. He is most trustworthy and should be visited specially.
Now return to the High Street, turn left, then right into Palace Street, and proceed down this until Number 45 is reached on the right. This is the premises of Mr. W. H. Stringer, occupying part of the former Palace of the Archbishops of Canterbury— Thomas A’Beckett lived there—and Mr. Stringer is an excellent antique dealer, with fine furniture of all kinds, highly recommended.
PUN BRED GE AWE LES
Tunbridge Wells is the main Kent centre for antiques, but there is not space in these notes to deal with more than a few pical businesses, firstly the outstanding establishment known as “Hillary’s,” to be found at the far end of the famous Pantiles.
237
ROUND THE ANTIQUE SHOPS
Here Mr R. M. Murdoch has taken a wonderful eighteenth century building, formerly Beau Nash’s celebrated gaming rooms, and converted it into the finest premises outside London— possibly the most beautiful premises in the world—for the display of only the most important English 18th century furniture, French furniture, also porcelain and glass.
“Hillary’s” decorative scheme inside resembles the whitest and most Palladian of William Kent interiors. It is an aesthetically grateful experience merely to wander in and look around. But the most remarkable feature of the business is that prices are low for the antiques, so that nobody need be afraid to consider a purchase —or order a complete scheme of decoration, in which the firm specialises. Orders have indeed varied from making a pair of curtains for a country cottage to furnishing an entire London Embassy. “Hillary’s’” stock all the fine period fabrics you may want. [he policy is low profits and a large turnover—and success.
Now return to the beginning of the Pantiles, and at Number 18b visit the smaller but no less fascinating establishment of Mr. S A. Gardner, a tiny shop which leads to a series of intriguing underground galleries, wherein will be found novelties like musical boxes, unusual clocks, and Tonbridge ware. ‘This is a good dealer to contact for anything off the beaten track.
There is a branch at 11 High Street, Tunbridge Wells, of Messrs. Crutch Bros.’ well-known Tonbridge antique business. It is as well to visit the shops in both towns. Tonbridge address is 188 High Street. Crutch Bros. specialise in old English furniture and “all ancillary services,” which is to say they are experts in period furnishing and decoration, and in all classes of restorations and repairs, besides carrying a very fine stock of genuine pieces. This is a good firm, in whose hands the collector can place him- self with confidence.
Finally note for Kent that Maidstone has the excellent business of Mrs. W. Draycon, on the left as you enter the town from the south at Number 52 King Street, favoured of American visitors who know Mrs. Draycon as trustworthy, cheap, and most tasteful in her choice of fine furniture, silver, porcelain—and wine-glasses.
Also remember that in Rochester, at Numbers 12, 18 and 19, High Street, are the original antique galleries of Charles Woollett and Son, the fine London firm, established 1889, noted for furniture, china, silver, glass and bric-a-brac.

NSO ROT HOF LONDON
Now for the North; and, from London a convenient first sto is Waltham Cross. Here, by the way, is the home of J. de Haan & Son, Ltd., Harold House, 73 High Street, not a firm which caters for the casual visitor, but one of our largest exporters of antiques, specialising in furniture, and such itemss as panelling, mantelpieces and fitments.
€ next interesting town is Hertford. Here the principal
dealers are Beckwiths, to be found in an ancient building at the Old Cross. The original Beckwith, it is said, was one of the famous 18th century cabinet-makers. Certainly the tradition of Guality is maintained today. Genuine antique furniture only is sold, always with some interesting country pieces; but a speciality here hich can really be recommended is pottery and porcelain. American collectors particularly know Beckwiths for pottery which cannot always be obtained elsewhere.
Further north still is Hitchin, where a very pleasant antique business is that of Mr. Percy A. Rodwell, at Numbers 7-8 Sun Street, on the right as the town is entered from London. There is

an attractive white shop-front, and, inside, eight showrooms containing furniture, silver and porcelain chosen by Mr. Rodwell as the fruits of a long lifetime’s experience.
ST. ALBANS
Yet another good antiques exit from London to the north—and perhaps the best—is via St. Albans, where there are the two fine shops of Mr. W. J. Lomas, a first-class specialist in Georgian furniture. (Mr. Lomas, a public-spirited young man of reputation second to none in these parts, was elected to the St. Albans City Council during the year.) Visit this firm if you want the real thing and the fairest dealing—also if you are interested in ancient inns, as the main establishment at 9 Holywell Hill was formerly the Dolphin Inn, and Mr. Lomas’s branch shop at 26 George Street was originally the Old George coaching inn, built on the site of a monastic hostel for pilgrims to the shrine of St. Albans.
DUNSTABLE Then at the next stop, Dunstable outside Luton, there is Harry Rixson, whose galleries in the Olde Retreate, at the centre of the village, contain a really splendid display of Old English furniture, panelling, fireplaces, and works of art generally. Messrs. Rixson

do a large trade business, but their premises are most attractive to casual visitors also, being part of the buildings of the ancient Priory. Messrs. Rixson meet trains from St. Pancras by appoint- ment—only 40 minutes from London. Guarantees are given with the goods.
Up the road from Rixson’s on the left are two other interesting dealers, Mr. P. E. Wallis, at 51 High Street South, who specialises most valuably in repairs to unusual and complicated movements of antique dee as well as singing birds and musical boxes; and secondly, that well-known name from former London days Mr. Alexander L. Podd (57 High Street South), who specialises in antique clocks to sell and particularly caters for the American market (furniture, pictures, jewellery, porcelain, bronzes, silver and glass).
At Number 26 Church Street there is yet another Rixson—Mr. William Rixson—and the shop will be found on the left soom after you enter the town from the direction of Luton. A few doors away Mr. Rixson has a large warehouse filled with antiques ob every description, collectors’ pieces and furnishing Pieces, something for everyone, including clocks, prints, and china.

ROUND THE ANTIQUE SHOPS
Indeed, Dunstable is almost unique for its size as an antique centre. There is still the firm of Blaise Preston, Ltd., at Number 152 High Street North, at the other end of the town (on the main Birmingham road) where fine furniture, pictures, porcelain, enamels and clocks are sold, but particularly pictures of out- standing interest, and—a notable sideline—antique needlework and materials.
BRETT - BRACKLEY
The north road from Dunstable leads to the architecturally interesting old town of Stony Stratford: and to the shops of “Michael Brett,” of which there are two, the first in the main street, and the leading establishment in the quiet of the Market Square, to the left off the main street. Here Major C. A. Brett, young and distinguished member of a famous antiques family, conducts a business with worldwide ramifications (particularly linked with Canada).
And it is a business outstanding for taste and importance of the antiques stocked, all exquisite and lovely, very fine English and French furniture and clocks, tapestries, porcelain (particularly figures) as well as novelties such as the unique musical automaton featured on the front page of this book. Major Brett caters directly for overseas buyers, to whom he can also offer carefully-selected shipments of the most fashionable bric-a-brac. He is a heavily-starred item on this trip.
After which it always pays to turn west a little and seek—it is on the Banbury road via Buckingham—the good little antiques centre of Brackley. Here Mr. C. J. E. Clare, at Number 28 Market Place, is a first-class dealer in only the best antique furniture, as well as porcelain, glass and silver. He is an outstandingly expert dealer for such a country district, and always stocks rare pieces. Further up the road, at Number 28 High Street, Brackley, is Chester House, which specialises this time in English and Dresden groups among fine porcelain and other interesting antiques—with a good café attached.
NORTH AMP TON
Two interesting little shops in Northampton will be found on the Kettering Road leading out from the centre of the town, on the right, first Number 158 where Mr. L. A. Baldwin sells antique silver, jewellery, and such specialities as ivories and coins, second Number 182, where Mr. Robert A. Baldwin, his

But there is another very interesting and remunerative road North via Shrewsbury, which can be started at say Worcester or Gloucester, after which the first antiques stop of the tour is Leominster, charming little market town with the business at Number 8 High Street of Lewis and March, controlled by a young man of taste and ability, Captain Henry, who is particularly interested in porcelain and pottery.
Standing athwart the road north next is that ancient and beautiful citadel of the Shropshire marches, Ludlow; and it has an antique dealer to match, F. H. Foxall, whose ever-intriguing galleries with their record number of long-case and other antique clocks will be found at Number 17, Bull Ring, centre of the town on the left of the road down the hill to Shrewsbury. And Shrewsbury itself, here is an “antiques” town indeed! Take, for

example, the establishment of Mr. George L. Reynolds, at 4 and 5 Dogpole, a turning off the main street. Mr. Reynolds has been in business for 40 years at this address. His premises are most attractive, and his taste in fine period furniture is very dependable. Royalty has bought from Mr. Reynolds. Or go down towards the Castle, and turn sharply left at Messrs. W. H. Smith the booksellers into School Gardens, where at Numbers 1 and 3 you will find the most impressive galleries of Mr. W. G. Dugdale, whose fine taste brings to a provincial town a reminder of Bond Street, and yet whose interest in local antiquities finds flower in frequent exhibitions of such items as sporting and farming prints. He sells fine antique furniture, well-arranged, as well as porcelain and pictures.
Or proceed to the historic Square, where behind the 400 years’ old Market Hall will be found one of the most ancient firms of goldsmiths and silversmiths in the country, Messrs. Robinson & Co., Ltd., (est. 1764) who under the discriminating direction of Mr. E.°C. Plimmer sell very fine antique silver as well as jewellery, clocks, furniture, porcelain and glass. Indeed, a visit to Shrewsbury is to be recommended !
To which may be added a useful suggestion, that the visitor to these parts stay at the homely guest house of Mr. H. Lloyd Shaw, “The Heights,” Little Wenlock, near Wellington and Shrewsbury—especially as Mr. Shaw is a fine professional restorer of brass and copper, porcelain and paintings: notably brass and copper, an unusual speciality.
The road north is interrupted next at Whitchurch in Shrop- shire, where it will be impossible to miss in the High Street

Mr. A. L. Wood’s “Olde Shoppe.” This is no fake but probably the oldest building in a very ancient little town. Formerly a Franciscan cell, it is gloriously apparelled with beam and plaster and black carving. Inside Mr. Wood has a remarkably extensive stock not only of furniture but also of silver. His silver stock must be as valuable as any in this part of England. Mr. Wood himself is a most interesting personality.
WELLESLEY WILSON
The slight deviation to Whitchurch was advised because of the pleasure experienced by the writer of these notes in turning the easy wheel of his “Oxford” through those smooth Shropshire byways. Afterwards he ran across into Cheshire through equally attractive motoring country, and so to Chester, where he parked conveniently in Watergate Street for a little while and proceeded to take a cross-sample of the antique dealers.
For the purpose of these notes he chose two as representative of the town, walking round the corner and mounting the famous Bridge Street Row—a street under cover built above a street in the unique Chester way, oaky, black and white, resounding with ship-like boards underfoot—to find at Number 43 the fine shop of Mr. Wellesley Wilson.
This is a business on no account to be missed by a visitor to the north-west. Mr. Wilson, though young, is probably the most important antique dealer in all this area, being the only one here- abouts to have a Stand at the London Antique Dealers’ Fair, and concentrating on the best only (though his shop with its 4 floors has an intimate, non-intimidating atmosphere). A tall Tompion rubbed shoulders with a Quare. A matchless marquetry bureau that Marot might have made stood beside a sumptuous lacquer cabinet: and there was Oriental porcelain, and yet much inexpensive but genuine stock for the less ambitious collector.
The other antique dealer chosen this year was similarly young, the artist Mr. John Nicholas, whose shop at Number 24 Water- gate Street was conveniently opposite where the car could be left for a while: a quiet establishment for bargains of taste, and completing a brief cross-section of Chester.

KNUTSFORD — MANCHESTER
Whereupon—and partly, it must be admitted, to extend the “Oxford” along one of the best motoring roads in England—a turn was made towards Knutsford, the little Cheshire town towards Manchester which was the original of Mrs. Gaskell’s “Cranford,” and which is still largely “Cranford” today. The easy car leapt to 70 miles per hour along a wide, safe, flat road among suave parklands of trees, then crept abashed into a prim and shaded little High Street, and stopped by a house where old Josiah Wedgwood used to stay when coming across to the Mersey to meet his shipments of kaolin. Opposite was the grand old George Inn, and next to the Inn was an antique dealer. Mr. John O. Curbishley is his name (although many readers, particularly Americans, will know it well) and this young Cheshire man of the wide experience specialises, at Number 72 King Street, Knuts- ford, in overseas and trade business. Should you seek early Victorian lustres or other strange nick-nacks of that period, ae will find them here, indeed much in antique furniture, china,
rass, silver, Sheffield plate, with particular attention to the requirements of the American trade.
Americans will be well-advised after Knutsford not to omit a run across to Stockport at the Hazel Grove or Macclesfield end, where there is a shop run by Mr. J. Milner at 292 London Road. Mr. Milner has recently opened a branch at 63 Oxford Road, Manchester, 200 yards from the Palace Theatre on the road to Wilmslow. He sells antique jewellery, Victoriana and antique silver.
Silver—the word evokes instantly a memory and an idea. Manchester, it is said, has no interest. for the antique collector. Well, that is as it may be, and we may disprove it yet, but while in these parts do not on any account omit to do what we do, and visit Ashton-under-Lyne. A run through the industrial district east of Manchester is interesting enough in itself. Here, for all the cobbled roads and strange odours, is one of the great industrial muscles of Britain. And, at Ashton, in the middle of the main street (Number 226 Stamford Street, to be exact) is a dealer in antique silver named Tom Kenworthy who had in stock when we visited him such a fine collection as had rarely been seen outside Pall Mall Safe Deposit—and at fantastically low prices: Hester Bateman, all the fashionable names. Remember—Tom Kenworthy !

PRESTON AND TREASURES
It is said that Preston, convenient centre on the main road north-west, is the only really good town for antiques in this part of the world. This is so—if you know how to find the dealers.
First, then, ask for “Treasures.” The immense series of galleries of this fine firm are situated in the quiet oasis of Pitt Street, behind the main road. Frederick Treasure founded the business 50 years ago. His son, Mr. Leighton Treasure, is now the head, with a very pleasant North Country personality, and a commonsense attitude towards prices—so that, a stroll round the showroom after showroom of antique furniture, silver, china and pictures will be bound to evoke some rare bargains. ‘““Treasures” have built up a really live export business, particularly with the United States, and always try to have goods available which are suitable for this market.
Then ask carefully again for Park Road in Preston, and enter the old antique shop at Number 91 of Mr. Charlie Parker. For 30 years Mr. Parker has been known as an honest dealer of real personality. He does a considerable trade business, has two
254

pleasant sons to follow him, and offers every kind of genuine antique and curio.
After which you can call on Mr. W. Miller in his interesting showroom down a passageway with the word “Antiques” out- side at Number 50a Fishergate, one of the main streets. Mr. Miller belongs to the younger school of dealers, specialises in furniture, porcelain and glass, and offers his wares sincerely and unobtrusively.
After Preston you can either proceed north or strike east across to Yorkhire. The present tour will continue north, but remember that it is a good idea to proceed to Blackburn while in this area— Blackburn being on the road east—and to visit at Number 14 Mincing Lane the reliable shop of Mr. F. E. Tinker, who has good antique furniture, as well as paintings and pictures (and an interesting speciality: miniatures).
Os ree tA KES
The road to the Lake District now runs north via Lancaster, the old capital of these parts, where there has been an outstanding antique dealer since 1860. Mr. W. A. Ordish, in China Street, still maintains the fine family name of this firm, and is worth visiting especially for eighteenth century furniture, though he also has an interesting collection of pictures.
Similarly in Kendal, the next town on the road, there are dealers of the type one associates with the best centres of the south. They will be found nearly together on the right as you travel up to the town centre, firstly J. R. Cookson, Ltd. (Georgian House, Highgate) wherein the young but extremely knowledgeable proprietor, Mr. W. E. Johnson, has an outstanding collection of porcelain, in addition to pottery, silver, fine furniture, Chinese ceramics and hardstones. Secondly, there is the establishment of Mr. G. W. Graves, 85 Highgate, equally a delight to visit because of the good condition in which the antiques are kept—small pieces of excellent patina. Kendal is indeed a surprise, and should never be omitted in any itinerary.
The same applies to the Lake District itself. Here is largely an untilled field for the collector. Every private house contains interesting antiques still. It is suggested, for a proper view of the scenery, that the visitor proceed first to Windermere, where he will find two good dealers, situated at Bowness down by the lake. The first is Telfords—of whom more later, when we reach Grasmere—occupying beautiful showrooms filled with

Then, to see the country, travel south to the secluded old town of Ulverston, because here, off the beaten track, you will find bargains in the establishments of Messrs. Fred Todd, The Gill, Brogden Street, also Buxton Place, and C. Williams, 25 King Street. The Todds have been established since 1872 and have the rare speciality of North Country oak. Mr. Williams is a newer dealer, but treasures are to be found among his curios at low prices.
From Ulverston take the scenically-fine road via Coniston to Ambleside, where Messrs. Fred Todd have a branch establish- ment at The Studio, Lake Road; and then proceed to Grasmere, that dear heart of the Lake District which is still unspoilt in its Guietness, though liberally equipped with all the comforts and interests that the visitor may need. Here are the Wordsworth grave and cottage, high hills round a green basin, and, on the main road at How Toe prominently, the gracious antique galleries of Mr. and Mrs. T. H. Telford, replete with furniture,
silver, china, pewter.

Nor are the possibilities of the Lake District—and the public- spirited Telfords—by any means exhausted yet. Onwards to Keswick, and find there at 4 Court Buildings an antique silver shop of the very best kind. This is run by Messrs. James Telford and Son, the actual business mentioned in “Prayer for My Son,” by Hugh Walpole, the great writer of these parts; and Mr. Telford as a Trustee of the local Museum, will show you MSS and other relics—also the famous Derwentwater chair. This will be an outstanding experience of the tour; and afterwards the visitor may visit another good dealer, John Young and Son, at 16 Main Street, who sells chiefly furniture, with some unusual North Country pieces.
PEN RIT Ho (CARLA SE
The Oxford accomplished with ease the long slope from Keswick to Penrith. Just before leaving this unspoilt little town of the hills, the eye was attracted by an antique shop on the right (Duke Street) and an investigation revealed: Mrs. L. Jordan. She is an elderly lady who (we learnt) has been known to stand up to the most redoubtable dealers at sales. For 50 years she has been buying and selling really first-class antiques . .. Visit her, as an experience and for bargains.
So for the last lap north and Carlisle, a town which for antiques gives a preliminary taste of Scotland, as the dealers are remarkable for the quality of the goods they sell and for their high insistence on the genuine. You cannot miss the excellent establishment of Messrs. James W. Clements at 56 Castle Street, right in the centre next to the Crown and Mitre Hotel. This business is now run by the late Mr. Clement’s charming daughter, and offers very lovely specimens of antique furniture, porcelain, silver, glass and jewellery. It may truly be said that only the best is offered. '

Scotland is entered now, and an account of the Scottish shops is given in a separate section of this book. We shall continue our English tour with: Newcastle-on-Tyne.
The Northumbrian city, first antiques stop proper as you come down the east coast from Scotland, has many dealers, but two must suffice for the purposes of this account, first Mr. J. J. Russell Agnew, who is a very go-ahead dealer with premises at Numbers 3 and 34 St. Mary’s Place. As you enter the city from the north you come to fork roads. At this point St. Mary’s Place is a sharp turning to the left. Mr. and Mrs. Agnew are both interesting personalities—the latter a well-known writer—and their business also is interesting, with a speciality in oak (there are alway many good gate-legs in stock) and in armour. Prices are low and the stock moves guickly.
Then find Saville Row, another turning on the left from the main road (Northumberland Street) to the city centre, where the specially recommended firm is that of Harold Hill and Son, Number 12c. The unusual specialities here are—bookcases and books on collecting. You can write to Harold Hill from any part of the world for the bookcase you want, and for the book, especially if it be on an out-of-the-way connoisseur’s subject.
On the way south after Newcastle a call is worth making at Middlesbrough. At Number 84 Linthorpe Road, centre of the town, the century-old firm of Merssrs. R. Richardson sell fine antique silver and clocks at low North Country prices. They have branches also at Darlington and Redcar and are members of the British Antique Dealers’ Association.
At Number 40 Wilson Street, a turning to the right further down Linthorpe Road, there is the shop of Messrs. Thorniley- Walker, Ltd., selling period furnishings, furniture, china and glass, but specially fabrics for antique covers and hangings.

reliable dealers of excellent taste, specialising particularly in two items, fine furniture and good antique silver, though they also carry porcelain and antique jewellery.
But Scarborough also has a very remarkable institution indeed, the famous King Richard II] House down on the Harbour Side. This wonderful 14th century building, wherein the Yorkist King stayed, has been carefully restored by Mr. E. H. Burrows and opened to the public, on the one side as a unique museum of antiquities, and on the other as an antique shop. Thousands of visitors regularly examine the three large floors of rare articles from man traps to lighting implements, from horse pillions to prisoner of war bone work, from early glass to exceedingly old oak; and the shop sells a very large variety of antique furniture, china, glass pewter, brass and copper. This is certainly an outstanding high-spot in our antiques tour of the country.
Scarborough has other dealers, but between Messrs. Boothman and Smith and King Richard House the visitor will have enough to occupy him on one trip, although he might also care to find in the street between the Royal and Grand Hotel (7 & 8 Marine Parade) the shop of Mr. Angus Graham, who sells some interesting porcelain, silver and antique jewellery.

YORK The Oxford sped next to York, which is perhaps one of the
most fascinating of all centres for the visitor. This city caters for the visitor, with its lovely Minster, its narrow, medieval streets alive and not dead, its comparative freedom from complete parking bans—and with such a personality among antique dealers as Mr. Charles E. Thornton, who sells at The Adams House, Petergate, one of the most interesting of old streets just under the Minster, only the best 18th century antiques, with specialities in furniture, porcelain and clocks (often he has several Tompions in stock). There is another Thornton establishment at “The Georgian House,” Blossom Street, and both businesses are outstandingly fine.
At the corner of Petergate and Stonegate, a short step back towards the Minster and facing the opening that leads to the Minster, is yet another fascinating shopfront, that of Mr. Henry Hardcastle (31 Stonegate) who sells a wide variety of antique British and foreign silver in a business whose roots go back to the year 1770. The silver is notable; there is also a large stock of antique jewellery; and visitors are invited to inspect a most remarkable panelled room inside which is itself a collector’s piece.

Proceed now to Number 39 Stonegate, and the antique shop of Mr. William Lee, yet another York personality, an exhibitor at the London Antique Dealers’ Fair, and a man of the type who will show you on the one hand a superb piece of William Kent furniture, and on the other hand a unique collection of York silver. Mr. Lee is concentrating particularly on trade business, and his name should be noted by overseas buyers.
So it could go on, but there is space only for one other dealer, Mr. Ron Hope, who at Number 3 Minster Gates, where Stone- gate and Petergate meet and lead to the Minster, has a shop wherein may always be found small pieces of great interest, as well as fine porcelain. Mr. Hope is a City Guildsman and very considerable craftsman who can be relied upon for “a square deal.”
But we must proceed towards Harrogate, and, on the way, pause in Knaresborough, Eugene Aram’s, Blind Jack’s, and old Mother Shipton’s ancient town. The exquisitely beautiful shop- front of Ann Driver’s antique business arrests attention in he High Street. Furniture, porcelain and objets d’art are sold at very reasonable prices. Then turn into the quaint Market Place and find the antique shop known as “Morrisons,” established 1860,

and presided over by a foremost lady “character” of the trade, who possesses a lifelong knowledge of porcelain which many a London dealer might envy (she has often “shown them”!) There is a considerable stock, particularly Rockingham, also glass and silver,
and “finds” for everybody.
HARROGATE
Harrogate is a beautiful town, ideal for holidays, and containing a most imposing array of antique dealers, who shall be sampled herewith.
There is, for example, an outstanding personality in Mr. Walter Waddingham, who will be found at a tasteful corner shop, Number 39 Swan Road, just opposite the famous Royal Baths. He specialises in old English furniture in original condition, and also carries the largest stock of Chinese porcelain in the provinces.
Or there is, nextdoor at Number 35 Swan Road, that fine old dealer Mr. Thomas Edwards, who founded his very solid reputation nearly 50 years ago, and who always has very reliable furniture, porcelain and bijouterie to show, as well as the silver of his own fine taste.

Then find at Number 10 Royal Parade, the renowned business of Mr. Charles Casimir, known as The Old Pewter Shop, and probably the outstanding specialist concern of its kind in the world. Here you will see, say, the earliest known specimen of a pewter candle stick, or a superbly engraved alms dish of 1670. Mr. Casimir may be said to lead his profession, and indeed you have to go to Harrogate to see really unusual pewter.
The Montpellier Gardens and Parade area is another good antiques quarter. Call upon Mrs. D. A. Cooksley at Number 6 Montpellier Gardens. This charming lady will show all kinds of antiques, particularly fine porcelain, and her stock may be recommended to trade buyers, who should mention THE ANTIQUES YEAR BOOK.
Then Mrs. A. M. Beevers, at Number 1 Montpellier Gardens, is a most reliable dealer in antique furniture, china, silver and Sheffield plate, also diamonds and jewellery. This business was established in 1880, and certainly inspires confidence. Note by the way, that Mrs. Beevers specialises in old lace, to buy or sell.

Now return to Montpellier Parade, and at Number 16 join the customers who so often throng the shop of Mrs. Elizabeth M. Hardy, a most enterprising and charming lady who always carries a very attractive stock of antique jewellery, silver, porce- lain, lace, brocades and shawls, and who is also developing an antique furniture department, particularly walnut and fine mahogany.
Lest, however, the feminine may be thought to predominate, it is suggested that the visitor find his way to 17 Commercial Street, and the shop of J. F. Shutt and Sons, antique furniture dealers of the old school, unpretentious, solid, and with a usefully low-priced stock.
Or just proceed to the main street of the town, Parliament Street (main road Leeds-Ripon), and visit at Number 29a therein the very attractive premises of Mr. G. S. Bolam, a young dealer who has made a great success in a few years thanks to offering all kinds of attractive antiques at very low prices.
And one more suggestion for Harrogate: there is an antiquarian bookshop, Messrs. Symington’s, at 13-15 Market Place, which always carries a large stock of books on collecting subjects. It is well worth a visit, or an inquiry by post for the furniture or porcelain or even the pot-lid book which you want.

Yorkshire for antiques, however, is not just Harrogate and York, no matter how splendid they may be. If you had entered the county from Blackburn in Lancashire, as earlier suggested, you would have come first to Skipton, a very pleasant little town, high upon the bracing road, with the atmosphere of sheep- farming still in the stone-clad streets; and of course it has through the ages accumulated antiques from the great houses and the farmhouses of the Yorkshire dales—some of which may be seen at the shop of Messrs. R. N. Myers and Son, in little, narrow Coach Street, a quiet abode of fine furniture pieces, some old glass, and even some rare porcelain.
Now run down the Leeds road to the growing and pleasant resort of Ilkley, always a surprise to visitors who have not been there before, and especially a surprise for the searchers after antique shops.
Keep a sharp look out on the right as you enter the town for the delightful establishment known as “Minton,” Church Street. Here in the Old Box Tree Cottage, complete with the original 16th century ingle-nook fireplace, Mrs. Kitty E. White (one of the most popular and charming of women dealers in the trade) sells

only those pieces most sought after by collectors, including unique small pieces of furniture. Further along the road, at Numbers 33 and 35 Church Street, is the fine old business of J. H. Cooper and Sons, carrying a large stock of moderate-priced antique furniture, with four large showrooms, and the sort of exciting arcade where you may find the bargain of the year naked and unashamed on the open pavement. Messrs. Cooper are also restorers, with a very high Yorkshire standard of workman-
ship.
INDUSTRIAL — AND ECONOMICAL
Next stop at the snug, sensible city of Bradford, wherein wise collectors sometimes get antiques cheaper than anywhere else— and that is no exaggeration, all classes of goods being offered.
The principal dealer is the very old-established firm of J. & W. Tweed, who will be found at Number 408 and 410 Leeds Road (on the way out of the city towards Leeds).
Tweeds have unpretentious premises in a poor quarter of an industrial city. Yet they are absolutely genuine, absolutely reliable dealers in unrestored antiques, and nearly always have

pieces to show which would pass scrutiny in the Victoria and Albert Museum. As a result they do a large trade business (untouched fine furniture of all periods, china, glass, paintings).
They are highly recommended.
Now proceed a short distance down towards Bradford again, and look carefully for Number 332 Leeds Road, as the shop of Mr. Robert Thompson there is a frequent port of call for some of the shrewdest American trade buyers who visit England. You will find the unpretentious establishment not to have been over- rated, a bonanza indeed of pottery, porcelain, glass, Victoriana and shipping goods.
Afterwards cut across the ty centre of Bradford and take the road leading to Keighley, which is Manningham Lane. Note on the right at Number 62 a very attractive new shop front at a corner: the business of Mr. Thomas A. Garnett, a newcomer who is stocking extremely tasteful pieces and selling them at extremely low prices. His acquaintance is certainly worth making.
Continue outwards until Manningham Lane becomes Keighley Road proper, and find on the right-hand side a large private house, Number 34. Here Mr. J. H. Croft caters

ROUND THE ANTIQUE SHOPS
especially for the American market and for the English trade in low-priced fine furniture, china, pottery, glass and pictures, all guaranteed (and please make an appointment!).
It is now suggested that a brief visit be made to Keighley, where Mr. F. J. McCarthy has an interesting business at Number 110 East Parade (turn left from Railway Station). He claims to sell the cheapest antiques in the north, and certainly can support this claim with his price-tickets. Oak is an unusual speciality here. Get in touch with young and enterprising Mr. McCarthy if you want a Yorkshire chair!
LEEDS
After which the Oxford made hay of the granite-setted road to Leeds—which is chiefly notable in the antiques world for two names. The old firm of W. W. Slee Ltd., established nearly 70 years at 30 Duncan Street (just across from the Corn Exchange) has a wholly individual character. No attempt is made to “show off” the really extensive stock of all kinds of antiques from
Toledo blades to gnarled, black old oak, and the visitor feels that

he is in the genuine “Quinneys’” at last. Furniture, silver, and paintings are perhaps the specialities, but very much more is offered—and once again at Leeds prices.
Then it is suggested that the visitor should aim for the bracing district of Moortown and interview at his residence, 154 Shadwell Lane, Mr. Gerald C. Dimery, who specialises in overseas business, particularly with the U.S.A. He can be relied upon to produce much good period furniture and porcelain, and is certainly the most enterprising wholesaler in these parts.
MORE DISCOV ERTIES
Our own route, ever in search of discoveries, now ran from Leeds to Hull. But Hull is also accessible from Scarborough, and should certainly be visited while the traveller is in Yorkshire, having at least one really fine antiques establishment, and several smaller firms. The establishment is that of Messrs. R. P. Carmichael and Co. Ltd., 53-63 George Street, premises covering 16,000 square feet, with four large antique showrooms. Much good antique furniture is sold, but silver, porcelain and antique jewellery are also offered on a veritable Bond Street scale (including some very interesting Victorian jewellery).
After which, almost replete with richness, we travelled back along the Leeds road and were very careful to turn south at Howden in order to reach Goole, the last of towns to produce a good antique dealer, and yet having at Numbers 62-64 Pasture Road (turn left in the town just before railway crossing) that well-known trade figure Mr. Allan Wale. Do not be deceived by the nature of his premises. Behind, and upstairs, he has a truly remarkable collection of good antique furniture, which has made him a trade wholesaler known throughout the country for good taste and low prices. This visit will not be regretted.
Goole, moreover, is on the main road north and south, and the trip can be continued south to Doncaster, home of a very fine antique dealer, Mr. L. Spero, whose establishment, ‘Peerage Antiques” at Number 36 Bennetthorpe contains not only five showrooms of fine English and Continental porcelain and other antiques, but also a large showroom which is mainly filled with export goods, in which Mr. Spero conducts a large trade (understandably, as the writer of these notes was once told by an American buyer that he loved our country but remembered it

especially for the kindness shown him in Doncaster, at “Peerage Antiques” !). Mr. Spero’s private address, by the way, is 11 Regent Square. He is really worth visiting, one of the most obliging and keen dealers in the trade today.
Then, before leaving Doncaster, don’t forget to look for Silver Street (turning off the main road as you proceed south), where Mrs. J. L. Forster continues her late husband’s antique business, china, glass furniture—and an especial interest in Rockingham.
NOTTINGHAMSHIRE AND _ LEICESTERSHIRE
So to Newark, one of the most pleasant and interesting towns of Nottinghamshire, where Messrs. Ford, at 11-13 Appleton Gate, sell old English furniture at a large establishment, but may be specially mentioned for Oriental carpets, of which their stock is probably the best to be found in the provinces. They have a skilled staff for the repairing and renovation of such carpets, and are also general antique furniture restorers.

The next stop is Nottingham, and a direction should be secured immediately to the ancient Castle, under the walls of which, at Number 100 Friar Lane in an excellent Regency building with very fine windows, will be found the very old firm of Messrs. W. A. Lewitt. A notable stock is carried in many showrooms of really good antique furniture, together with paintings, prints, silver, plate, china, glass and general antiquities.
Then almost next door, at Number 86 Friar Lane is the similarly good establishment of Messrs. W. Pease and Son, specialists in most exquisite and notable pieces of English porcelain and pottery (although furniture, silver, glass and needlework are also sold). The writer of these notes recorded that Messrs. Pease had porcelain and pottery (Chelsea, Derby, Ralph Wood, etc.) more than equal to the London best, but at far lower prices.

Proceeding south, the traveller comes to Loughborough. By branching off to the left from the Post Office down Baxter Gate he will find opposite the very noble 13th century parish church an excellent and attractive antique business, Charles Lowe & Sons of Church Gate. The proprietor is a very gracious personality of the old school. A short distance out of Loughborough town on the Leicester Road will be found yet another kind of business, the Lantern Galleries of Mr. J. S. Oliver, a craftsman who in another age might have been recognised as were the great cabinet- makers of the 18th century. The reproductions and conversions that he offers are very fine.
Yet again, at Quorn farther along the road, “Mercy Jeboult,” (Mr. and Mrs. Palmer of 5, 7 and 9 High Street), offers the most exquisite French furniture and other kindred items in a jade green shop (circa 1800) that is one of the most attractive of its kind.

Entering Leicester after Quorn, the eye is similarly attracted by the pleasant establishment of Mrs. F. Townshend at the Abbey Galleries (172 Belgrave Gate). Setting herself a high standard, and dealing as does “Mercy Jeboult’”? with discriminat- ing customers from the county, Mrs. Townshend has fine furniture, porcelain and similar antiques with some outstanding pieces always in stock.

Entering the city proper of Leicester one next proceeds to Loseby Lane in the centre, where is situated the St. Martin’s Galleries of Messrs. Withers, one of the oldest and finest firms of antique dealers in this part of England. The young and energetic proprietor, Mr. J. M. Frings, will be found as tasteful in his choice of really good 18th century furniture, particularly mahogany, as he is sensible in his low price-markings—among the lowest in the provinces—and really interesting bargains in silver, Sheffield, porcelain and such items as paperweights will also be discovered with a rare joy.
290
ROUND THE ANTIQUE SHOPS
An excellent old business that must at all costs be visited in Leicester is Frank Stevenson’s at 8, 10, 14 and 16 Wharf Street. Period furniture is displayed in profusion among many show- rooms, and Mr. Stevenson has what is rare among dealers of today, a predilection for oak. It is possible to spend hours in this shop and almost impossible not to buy, so attractive are some of the unusual pieces on show.
And remember—Leicester has in the firm of Edgar Backus at 46 Cank Street, a very good antiquarian bookseller who can be relied upon to supply, procure or buy books on collecting subjects as well as fine books to collect for their own sake.
STAMFORD
A good plan now is to strike across to Stamford, the main Lincolnshire centre for antiques.
Opposite the Town Hall and St. Mary’s Church in Stamford itself is the very old business of Scotney & Son (13 and 15 St. Mary’s Hill). Ask to be conducted to the old Crypt under one of Mr. Scotney’s shops. This dates back to the 13th century, with fine groining—but the antique-minded visitor will be no less impressed by Mr. Scotney’s very comprehensive stock of general antiques, every kind, but especially old English furniture, works of art, mirrors, porcelain and glass.
And now, on the road out of Stamford you will find on the left (Number 35 St. Martin’s) the establishment of Messrs. A. F. Smith and Son, where a fine selection of antiques is always on view. Excellent 18th century furnishings are displayed, together with many interesting country pieces, while a large stock of antique copper and brass never fails to attract the eye, and

For the next interesting experience proceed down the Great North Road 64 miles to Wanstord and a short semi-circular lane which loops back to that road further down. Signposted “Stibbington Only,” the lane leads to Stibbington Manor, a delightful early Jacobean stone house with mullion windows and with the notable collection of antiques of Mr. Frank Skevington.
The collection comprises fine period furniture, English and French clocks, old English glass, English Continental and Chinese porcelain, and works of art generally. This is indeed an unusual antique business. Mr. Skevington is a delightful mentor who shows his stock as it should be in a good home—and the pieces are very clean and well displayed.
The bracing air of these parts and the pleasure of visiting Stibbington Manor excites the mind for further discoveries—and lo, if you turn after entering Peterborough to the Lincoln Road and proceed to Number 293, a small shop, you will certainly be satisfied. This is the notable little business of Mr. and Mrs. Potter, a most energetic and enterprising young couple with a flair for finding porcelain, glass, lustres, chandeliers which they offer at very low prices, also lamps which they make almost at cost from Dresden groups and the like. Do note this address and you won't regret it.

East Anglia is a very wide territory, wherein a few good antique dealers are situated at strategic points on what could be an interesting tour, starting, say, at King’s Lynn, which has one or two small shops—opposite the very lovely St. Margaret’s Church, at Number 2 Saturday Market Place, is “Lincoln’s,” a favourite browsing-ground for seekers after unusual antique jewellery and small curios—and going on to Heacham a few miles out on the Hunstanton road.
Here will be found the very old-established firm of George Robinson & Son (Pear Tree House, Heacham) not to be missed on the left as the village is entered. Mr. Sydney Robinson will

The Ancient Bouse IPSWICH
When in IPSWICH be sure to visit the Ancient House, situated in the Buttermarket. This famous old Elizabethan House is probably unique in the world. Apart from its antiquarian considerations, much interest will be found in the admirable display of BOOKS—FANCY GOODS—STATIONER Y—MAPS ARTISTS’ MATERIALS—NEWSPAPERS & MAGAZINES

conduct the visitor through many showrooms of fine old English furniture, an absolutely trustworthy stock, and will also be particularly interested to discuss paperweights, of which he is himself a keen collector. He has in addition silver, glass and porcelain and welcomes the trade
The next high spot in Norfolk is Cromer, home of the Levines.
Mr. E. D. Levine, at the Antique Gallery, Church Street, has an outstandingly good stock of fine furniture (in six showrooms) and, for these parts, possesses a surprisingly fine collection of Chinese and English porcelain. A visit to Cromer is, indeed, strongly recommended.
(Norwich is to be covered in a later ANTIQUES YEAR BOOK.)
SUFFOLK
A visit to Bury St. Edmunds suitably introduces Suffolk. The town possesses so many historic features that it should not in any case be missed. Ask, however, for Arlington House, Bury Street. Here Messrs. Dutton Bros., young men, continue a very old antique business inherited from their father, which specialises in country pieces, but also has a good stock of porcelain and Stafford- shire figures. There is a staff of expert restorers and discerning collectors have learnt to send furniture to Duttons for repairs from all parts of the country.
Similarly of historic and architectural interest is Ipswich, where there are some small antique dealers, and a fine, long-established firm, Green and Hatfield, whose Old Curiosity Shop, Northgate Street, is of London standard, with the largest stock in Suffolk of English antique furniture, china, silver, Sheffield plate and glass. While in Ipswich, moreover, do not omit to visit

ROUND THE ANTIQUE SHOPS
the Ancient House, Butter Market. This is not an antique dealer’s, but a very fine bookseller’s. It is possibly the finest specimen of domestic English architecture of the 16th century, with a wonderful pargetted facade, and interiors carefully preserved.
Also of interest in Ipswich is the firm of Frasers, Princes Street. They sell some good antique silver, and usually have a few pieces of good antique furniture, while they undertake expert restorations.
And while in this area do not.on any account omit a visit to the lovely, unspoilt village of Lavenham (near Sudbury in the Constable country) where Mr. R. McCausland-White — of Folkestone has the home of his fine antique businesses. .
Or overlook a call on Cambridge, which has several old dealers and some very enterprising younger ones, such as Mr. Thomas C, Gotobed at Number 12 and 18 Lensfield Road, who sells old English furniture, china, glass, needlework and the like, and has established himself firmly thanks to the personal attention he pays to customers and the very small profits he is content to take from
the lovely things he sells.
Then there is an energetic dealer with similar ideas, Mr. Hedworth L. Roe, who at Number 31 Trinity Street preserves the traditions of a Cambridge family which has been selling antiques since 1826, and notably offers silver, jewellery, enamels, china, glass, paperweights and ivories. He is always very encouraging to the undergraduate collector.
AND RAFCEEEFSE
Now it is suggested that the final return to London be made via Colchester to the fine main road, where the village of Kelvedon will present an outstanding experience for any tour. In the village is a charming small antique shop, beautifully decorated with a fine period front. This belongs to G. T. Ratcliffe, Ltd., and has featured in a film: has much pottery, porcelain, and small pieces with a French atmosphere. Now proceed roughly half-a- mile into the country towards Chelmsford and look out for the tall pile of an old house on the left known as Durwards Hall.
Here Mr. Ratcliffe and his attractive wife conduct what is undoubtedly the largest and most enterprising antique business in all this part of England. The old Hall has no fewer than 33 showrooms, each filled with excellent stock. Mr. Ratcliffe himself,

There are sidelines such as armour, wrought ironwork, and period architectural fittings. And, although energetic Mr. Ratcliffe is a careful member of the British Antique Dealers’ Association, he at the same time does not disdain to provide high-quality restored old pieces for those who require reasonably-priced furniture.
After this unique experience, the visitor may pause in Chelmsford on the way back to London and go through the interesting stock of yet another Ratcliffe business, at 24 Duke Street. He will certainly be grateful, amid the comparative desert of Essex, for this one man’s good initiative.

Round the Antique Shops of Scotland
STILL one of the most exciting of adventures is a visit to Scotland. Added to this feeling in the case of the writer of these notes as he sped smoothly in his new Morris Oxford north from Carlisle across the Teviots of rising hills, heather, willowherb and pine- woods, was the familiar qualified anticipation of the collector who turns to new bottles for his delight. Would there be discovery or disappointment? Was it true that in the search for antiques one should not waste time north of London, Birmingham, Preston, Newcastle? Little was heard in the south of Scottish antique dealers, save of Aberdeen’s famous John Bell and the redoubtable Loves of Perth. “Don’t waste your time and petrol.”” Sut the car leapt at the keener air, and the journey to Edinburgh, over the fine roads that are nearly always found in Scotland today, was accomplished in a few exhilarating hours.

It was Edinburgh at the time of the great annual Festival of Music and Drama, and an enchanted city at once. The sensation was akin to that of the Englishman who visits the plenty of Switzerland after years of old clothes at home. Here was perhaps the most aesthetically satisfying city in the world at its annual, new-painted best, and Princes Street, that peerless thoroughfare, a caravanserai of colour and fashion, with each “monied stall” a shop containing the best in modern and ancient merchandise, and in—silver.
“They should have told us!” was the instant exclamation; but then, who was there before this pioneering visit to tellP Who was there to make a book of this kind and insist therein that Edinburgh for the sale of antique silver is as Covent Garden for opera or Hollywood for films.
Begin, for example, methodically at the western approach of great Princes Street, which is Shandwick Place, wherein several shops of antique interest will be found at once, but primarily the establishment of George Cockburn at Number 20. This firm has been retailing fine silver since 1879, but in the hands of Mr. I.

Rosenbloom, most charming and helpful of mentors, has become a rival in stock and taste to any of London’s Bond Street dealers. The interior is compact like a jewel-case, but a-glitter with piled attraction. Here you can find silver of all periods, Sheffield plate, the most sought-after items of antique jewellery: as a beginning.
Because the great walk can now continue down Princes Street with the cragged castle like a fantastic stage-set on the right underneath the clawed, macabre rise of Arthur’s Seat, along the pavements where the fame of the world jostles shoulders in all costumes from kilt to sari, till at Number 139 more silver glistens and it is Wilson and Sharps, a firm that has been dealing in fine period silver for the last 60 years. The stock comprises a very fine selection of antique silver dating from Charles II, 1679. One showcase was quite perfect, each item, from quaich to sugar- caster, traprain dish to chased-handled dirk an unspoilt collectors’ piece.

And so onward, past the gorgeous tea-shops—sorry, into the gorgeous tea-shops—until at Number 80 the bright scene is enhanced by a broad window with much within of antique inter- est. We are at the well-known establishment of Messrs. Wildman Bros., who sell everything from antique silver to porcelain, and from antique jewellery to fine period furniture. This is a shop with the atmosphere of Sévres enamel ware, in which one could be detained by fascination almost indefinitely.
But on again, with the Calton Hill ahead rearing its Roman columns in constant reminiscence of Edinburgh’s true classical ancestry through Antonine and Adam; and we come to the shop at Number 59 of Messrs. Mackay and Chisholm, oldest of all with its roots in the year 1780 and a Chisholm still in command. These are famous silversmiths who held the Warrant of King George IV, and are today goldsmiths to Queen Mary. Imagine their stock of the best Edinburgh and English silver— or, better still, go at the earliest opportunity to see it.

Now turn left off Princes Street and take the first turning to the right, which is narrow Kose Street, at the St. David’s Street end of which is Number 12 and the shop of Harry Chernack, one of the hardest-working and most likeable personalities in the trade, famed for his fair deals in antique silver and Shefheld plate at very reasonable prices always—also for a great helpmate in his charming wife. Mr. Chernack specialises in overseas business. Do not omit him.
And so it could go on. Edinburgh is undoubtedly a second London in antique dealing, with the accent on silver. It may be doubted whether another town or city in the world has so much antique silver to offer in such an attractive setting.

Another—and indeed one of the oldest—of antique furniture dealers is Messrs. Herrald, Number 38 Queen Street, which is to be found by proceeding down Frederick Street from Princes Street and looking for an imposing establishment on a right-hand corner. The shop is solid within as without, offering fine and reliable furniture with accent on the famous Scottish mahogany, but also selling Sheffield plate, china, glass and brass. It is under- standable that Herralds have been patronised by Royalty.
Or there is that outstanding personality among the younger antique dealers, Mr. Louis Henry, son of a famous High Street name, whose very pleasant shop of antique jewellery, Sheffield plate, porcelain, glass, objets d’art, is situated at Number 15 Hanover Street, turning off Princes Street opposite the National Gallery and Academy.
And, since the intent is to show that Edinburgh has everything to offer the discerning collector, there is Messrs. Whytock and Reid, occupying a magnificent Georgian house in Charlotte Square at the west end of George Street. They make modern furniture, they design modern carpets: indeed, their work is among the finest being done today: but they also carry genuine antiques and they specialise in period lay-outs and decorating, all in the most careful taste.

The “Oxford” was driven at speed north to Aberdeen, and the trip can be advised, because the roads are fine, the air is a tonic, and the distance seemingly inconsiderable to a modern car which yet used very little petrol. Beautiful Perth was explored on the way—with interesting results which will be described later—and then memories of the street of silver in Edinburgh were overtaken and temporarily overcome by the first sight of Aberdeen the Silver City, lying outspread beneath the road beside the sea and scintillating where the sun illumined a myriad facets of the
superb granite architecture.
To visit Aberdeen will soon be a fashionable thing, so much being offered here, champagne atmosphere, good food, several beaches of golden sands like those of Sydney, the brown wonder of the great fishing fleet—and the establishment of John Bell.
The word “establishment” is used advisedly because to call it an antique shop would be a misnomer. The showrooms in Bridge Street occupy six floors with an area of something like 20,000 square feet. They are probably the largest and most desirable premises anywhere for the display of antiques; and it is a remarkable tribute to the energy and acumen of Mr. W. S. Bell, the proprietor, that a provincial city, right at the north of Scotland, should produce this wonder against the competition of the world.
Go, then, to Aberdeen for sure, and, if you are a visitor from overseas, know that you are placing yourself in the right hands, because Bell’s export business is the best outside London, has an international reputation, and everything genuine and old and beautiful is offered in wholesale quantities, with the accent on that beautiful mahogany furniture of the late 18th and early 19th centuries which is Scotland’s main contribution to the best kind of anticues apart from silver.
HIGHLANDS
And now, the suggestion is made that the reader follow the track of the writer, and, instead of returning by the coast road, strike boldly into the Highlands and come down to Perth via Braemar. It is as foolish to go into Scotland without seeing the Highlands as to collect pottery without touching Ralph Wood. And, if the suggested road is taken, John Bell’s second shop can be visited, that at Braemar, only eight miles from Balmoral

Castle, a jewel amid purple hills in the most beautiful part of Scotland. Bell keeps this shop open from June till October each year, which are the months for visiting the Highlands.
So to Perth, which provides further Scottish surprises, a lovely city, old capital of Scotland, on a beautiful river surrounded by the green of ancient battlefields whereon the clans clashed and kings died, where today great distilleries permeate the soft air with the perfume of what seems suspiciously like whisky, and where there are several antique dealers, notably Thomas Love and Sons, William Fettes and Son, and Graham Henderson.
Under the 13th century Kirk of St. John—in St. John’s Place— is the large establishment of Loves, one of the largest and best in the land. The specialities are genuine antique furniture, china, glass and carpets. One saloon is devoted exclusively to the display of rare Continental, English and Chinese porcelain, also fine glass, with outstanding examples of Dresden, Bow, Chelsea, Worcester. Bristol and the like. Loves are, however, worth contacting for pictures, miniatures and old prints alone. With typical Scottish enterprise this fine firm has a fleet of 10 specially constructed
motor vans for the conveyance of valuable pieces to all parts of the British Isles.
The Fettes establishment will be seen on the right as the road from the north enters the town, at Number 15 Atholl Street to be precise, and immediately recognisable by the tall painting of the grandfather clock outside. Inside a remarkable succession of showrooms—decorated round the walls with Scottish sayings— accommodates a first-rate all-round stock of fine antiques. Mr. Peter Fettes, the proprietor, has a rare feeling for the beautiful and is a generous business man. He stocks pictures as well as

And, “where the trade buys there suck I’ might be a good motto for intelligent collectors.
It is a motto which applies particularly to the great Glasgow which is now quickly reached.

“TOOD OLD GLASGIE TOON”
There are great English industrial cities which are almost entirely beyond the pale so far as antiques are concerned. This does not apply to Glasgow, wherein many days can be spent exploring really good antique shops. If Edinburgh was predominantly the mine for silver, Glasgow is chiefly a great furniture warehouse. Other antiques are sold, but the period furniture departments are oustanding.
Take, for example, the fine firm of Muirhead, Moffat and Co. Their premises are to be found at Numbers 132-136 Blythswood Street, a turning off Sauchiehall Street at the eastern end. Many showrooms display a superb stock of furniture, silver, pictures, porcelains, weapons and armour, pewter; and the firm also has one of the best workshops in Scotland for the undertaking of all kinds of restoration work. The writer of this account was most impressed by the business-like and enterprising qualities of the directors, and by the special displays of Scottish antiquities, which should attract visitors from all parts of the world.
319
ROUND THE ANTIQUE SHOPS OF SCOTLAND
Then there is the Glasgow branch of Aberdeen’s John Bell, at 398 Sauchiehall Street, managed by discerning Mr. Young and truly as polished a business as any in the kingdom. The furniture is in splendid condition and of exceedingly good colour always. There are several floors and enough of interest to keep the visitor wandering round for hours as in a collectors’ dream.
Indeed, that was very nearly the Glasgow fate of the writer of these notes. While in Sauchiehall Street he thought he would call on the firm of Ernest Alexander, 5-9 Dundas Place. He entered a modest shop and found Mr. Alexander to be not only an outstanding human personality, but also a foremost export specialist, doing a huge trade in early Victorian furniture and objets d’art, silver, lustres, lamps, porcelain, with a warehouse at the back, crammed to the top with stock for wholesale sale—and for the attention of the keen private buyer. Amercan buyers return again and again to this friendly dealer, with good reason.
A similar trade but chiefly in antique silver, Sheffield plate and porcelain is done by Mr. B. Alexander, at 134 West Nile Street, special attention being paid to the needs of the American and Canadian export markets. This young man is keen and always ready to find the unusual piece or take on an out-of-the-way commission.
AS FULLS BAG
So Glasgow goes on. It is like that. We could continue for pages, but must discriminate, and yet cannot place these dealers in order, nearly all of them deserving to come first. The method adopted has been that of geographical order, to save recrimina- tions, and accordingly we proceed now to the west end of the city, coming first to Number 14 Newton Street beside Charing Cross, where the firm of S. Winestone and Son, Ltd., has a splendid business with no fewer than 20 rooms, specialising in smail, fine furniture, in silver, porcelain and glass. As each business has its characteristic interest, so have Winestones, and theirs is the study of period decorations, so that when you buv your antiques you can enlist their expert aid in the arrangement of rooms and colour schemes.
Then in Woodlands Road, the main thoroughtare leading west, is the very solid firm of A. Macdonald (Number 188), old

established yet in young, live hands—Mr. Alfred Macdonald is known far south in England as a keen buyer—with interesting specialities again. Oak is rare in Scotland, but the Macdonalds usually have some very good oak indeed, and they sell china and | glass also, fine period pieces only, this applying also to the furniture, which ranges over all woods and styles.
And we have dealt with the leading Glasgow dealers only, not with all of them, and left out dozens of smaller firms and old curiosity shops. Why, in Chisholm-Hunters alone, at 27-29 Trongate, Glasgow has a mine for collectors of the old and curious. In a quick look round the writer came across two pieces of furniture used by Queen Victoria in 1840, as well as some very interesting silver and porcelain, and bagpipes, and sporrans—-and Glasgie indeed began to go roond and roond.
Scotland, of course, has more than all that, and it will be revisited and the account amplified next year. In the meantime, however, it may be seen that it is quite a good idea occasionally to Go North.
