Tragedy, the genre that had been co-opted by Aeschylus to capture the new euphoria after the battle of Salamis, was more usually devoted to subjects drawn from mythology. But very often, Athenian dramatists would give a topical twist to their reenactment of a well-known story. According to Aristotle, writing a century after the heyday of ‘classical’ drama, the nature of tragedy was ‘by means of pity and fear to bring about the purging of such emotions’.28 Comedy was more overtly topical. On the comic stage it was a regular occurrence for prominent citizens and political issues to be caricatured, often with a hefty dose of obscenity as well as bravura. Among extravagant whimsies brought onto the Athenian stage, one that is still with us today is Cloud-Cuckooland (Nephelokokkygia)—still invoked, as it was then, to mean a never-never land of politicians’ promises.
