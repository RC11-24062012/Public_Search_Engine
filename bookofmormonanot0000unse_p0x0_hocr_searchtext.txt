UPON PLATES TAKEN FROM THE PLATES OF NEPHI
Wherefore, it is an abridgment of the record of the people of Nephi, and also of the Lamanites—Written to the Lamanites, who are a remnant of the house of Israel; and also to Jew and Gentile—Written by way of command- ment, and also by the spirit of prophecy and of revelation—Written and sealed up, and hid up unto the Lord, that they might not be destroyed—To come forth by the gift and power of God unto the interpretation thereof— Sealed by the hand of Moroni, and hid up unto the Lord, to come forth in due time by way of the Gentile—The interpretation thereof by the gift of God
An abridgment taken from the Book of Ether also, which is a record of the people of Jared, who were scattered at the time the Lord confounded the language of the people, when they were building a tower to get to heaven—Which is to show unto the remnant of the House of Israel what great things the Lord hath done for their fathers; and that they may know the covenants of the Lord, that they are not cast off forever—And also to the convincing of the Jew and Gentile that JESUS is the CHRIST, the ETERNAL GOD, manifesting himself unto all nations—And now, if there are faults they are the mistakes of men; wherefore, condemn not the things of God, that ye may be found spotless at the judgment-seat of Christ.

INTRODUCTION
The Book of Mormonis a volume of holy scripture comparable to the Bible. It is a record of God’s dealings with the ancient inhabitants of the Americas and contains, as does the Bible, the fulness of the everlasting gospel.
The book was written by many ancient prophets by the spirit of prophecy and revelation. Their words, written on gold plates, were quoted and abridged by a prophet-historian named Mormon. The record gives an account of two great civilizations. One came from Jerusalem in 600 B.c., and afterward separated into two nations, known as the Nephites and the Lamanites. The other came much earlier when the Lord confounded the tongues at the Tower of Babel. This group is known as the Jaredites. After thousands of years, all were destroyed except the Lamanites, and they are the principal ancestors of the American Indians. :
The crowning event recorded in the Book of Mormon is the personal ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ among the Nephites soon after his resurrection. It puts forth the doctrines of the gospel, outlines the plan of salvation, and tells men what they must do to gain peace in this life and eternal salvation in the life to come.
After Mormon completed his writings, he delivered the account to his son Moroni, who added a few words of his own and hid up the plates in the hill Cumorah. On September 21, 1823, the same Moroni, then a glorified, resurrected being, appeared to the Prophet Joseph Smith and instructed him relative to the ancient record and its destined translation into the English language.
In due course the plates were delivered to Joseph Smith, who translated them by the gift and power of God. The record is now published in many languages as a new and additional witness that Jesus Christ is the Son of the living God and that all who will come unto him and obey the laws and ordinances of his gospel may be saved.
Concerning this record the Prophet Joseph Smith said: ‘“‘I told the brethren that the Book of Mormon was the most correct of any book on earth, and the keystone of our religion, and a man would get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts, than by any other book.”’
In addition to Joseph Smith, the Lord provided for eleven others to see the gold plates for themselves and to be special witnesses of the truth and divinity of the Book of Mormon. Their written testimonies are included herewith as ‘‘ The Testimony of Three Witnesses’’ and ‘‘The Testimony of Eight Witnesses.’’
We invite all men everywhere to read the Book of Mormon, to ponder in their hearts the message it contains, and then to ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ if the book is true. Those who pursue this course and ask in faith will gain a testimony of its truth and divinity by the power of the Holy Ghost. (See Moroni 10: 3-5.)
Those who gain this divine witness from the Holy Spirit will also come to know by the same power that Jesus Christ is the Savior of the world, that Joseph Smith is his revelator and prophet in these last days, and that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the Lord’s kingdom once again established on the earth, preparatory to the second coming of the Messiah.
THE TESTIMONY OF THREE WITNESSES
BE IT KNOWN unto all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people, unto whom this work shall come: That we, through the grace of God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, have seen the plates which contain this record, which is a record of the people of Nephi, and also of the Lamanites, their brethren, and also of the people of Jared, who came from the tower of which hath been spoken. And we also know that they have been trans- lated by the gift and power of God, for his voice hath declared it unto us; wherefore we know of a surety that the work is true. And we also testify that we have seen the engravings which are upon the plates; and they have been shown unto us by the power of God, and not of man. And we declare with words of soberness, that an angel of God came down from heaven, and he brought and laid before our eyes, that we beheld and saw the plates, and the engravings thereon; and we know that it is by the grace of God the Father, and our Lord jesus Christ, that we beheld and bear record that these things are true. And it is marvelous in our eyes. Nevertheless, the voice of the Lord commanded us that we should bear record of it; where- fore, to be obedient unto the commandments of God, we bear testimony of | these things. And we know that if we are faithful in Christ, we shall rid our garments of the blood of all men, and be found spotless before the judgment- seat of Christ, and shall dwell with him eternally in the heavens. And the honor be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost, which is one God. Amen.

THE TESTIMONY OF EIGHT WITNESSES
BE IT KNOWN unto all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people, unto whom this work shall come: That Joseph Smith, Jun., the translator of this work, has shown unto us the plates of which hath been spoken, which have the appearance of gold; and as many of the leaves as the said Smith has trans- lated we did handle with our hands; and we also saw the engravings thereon, all of which has the appearance of ancient work, and of curious workmanship. And this we bear record with words of soberness, that the said Smith has shown unto us, for we have seen and hefted, and know of a surety that the said Smith has got the plates of which we have spoken. And we give our names unto the world, to witness unto the world that which we have seen. And we lie not, God bearing witness of it.

TESTIMONY OF THE PROPHET JOSEPH SMITH
The Prophet Joseph Smith’s own words about the coming forth of the Book of Mormon arez
“On the evening of the. ..twenty-first of September [1823]...I betook myself to prayer and supplication to Almighty God....
“While I was thus in the act of calling upon God, I discovered a light appearing in my room, which continued to increase until the room was lighter than at noonday, when immediately a personage appeared at my bedside, standing in the air, for his feet did not touch the floor.
“He had on a loose robe of most exquisite whiteness. It was a whiteness beyond anything earthly I had ever seen; nor do I believe that any earthly thing could be made to appear so exceedingly white and brilliant. His hands were naked, and his arms also, a little above the wrists; so, also, were his feet naked, as were his legs, a little above the ankles. His head and neck were also bare. I could discover that he had no other clothing on but this robe, as it was open, so that I could see into his bosom.
“Not only was his robe exceedingly white, but his whole person was glorious beyond description, and his countenance truly like lightning. The room was exceedingly light, but not so very bright as immediately around Be person. When I first looked upon him, I was afraid; but the fear soon
eft me.
“He called me by name, and said unto me that he was a messenger sent from the presence of God to me, and that his name was Moroni; that God had a work for me to do; and that my name should be had for good and evil among all nations, kindreds, and tongues, or that it should be both good and evil spoken of among all people.
‘He said there was a book deposited, written upon gold plates, giving an account of the former inhabitants of this continent, and the source from whence they sprang. He also said that the fulness of the everlasting Gospel was contained in it, as delivered by the Savior to the ancient inhabitants;
‘Also, that there were two stones in silver bows—and these stones, fas- tened to a breastplate, constituted what is called the Urim and Thummim— deposited with the plates; and the possession and use of these stones were what constituted Seers in ancient or former times; and that God had prepared them for the purpose of translating the book.
Ye *& * Fee)
“Again, he told me, that when I got those plates of which he had spoken —for the time that they should be obtained was not yet fulfilled—I should not show them to any person; neither the breastplate with the Urim and Thummim; only to those to whom I should be commanded to show them; if I did I should be destroyed. While he was conversing with me about the plates, the vision was opened to my mind that I could see the place where the plates were deposited, and that so clearly and distinctly that I knew the place again when I visited it.
“After this communication, I saw the light in the room begin to gather immediately around the person of him who had been speaking to me, and it continued to do so, until the room was again left dark, except just around
him, when instantly I saw, as it were, a conduit open right up into heaven, and he ascended until he entirely disappeared, and the room was left as it had been before this heavenly light had made its appearance.
“I lay musing on the singularity of the scene, and marveling greatly at what had been told to me by this extraordinary messenger; when, in the midst of my meditation, I suddenly discovered that my room was again beginning to get lighted, and in an instant, as it were, the same heavenly messenger was again by my bedside.
‘“‘He commenced, and again related the very same things which he had done at his first visit, without the least variation; which having done, he informed me of great judgments which were coming upon the earth, with great desolations by famine, sword, and pestilence; and that these grievous judgments would come on the-earth in this generation. Having related these things, he again ascended as he had done before.
‘‘By this time, so deep were the impressions made on my mind, that sleep had fled from my eyes, and I lay overwhelmed in astonishment at what I had both seen and heard. But what was my surprise when again I beheld the same messenger at my bedside, and heard him rehearse or repeat over again to me the same things as before; and added a caution to me, telling me that Satan would try to tempt me (in consequence of the indigent circumstances of my father’s family), to get the plates for the purpose of getting rich. This he forbade me, saying that I must have no other object in view in getting the plates but to glorify God, and must not be influenced by any other motive than that of building His kingdom; otherwise I could not get them.
‘‘After this third visit, he again ascended into heaven as before, and I was again left to ponder on the strangeness of what I had just experienced; when almost immediately after the heavenly messenger had ascended from me the third time, the cock crowed, and I found that day was approaching, so that our interviews must have occupied the whole of that night.
“T shortly after arose from my bed, and, as usual, went to the necessary labors of the day; but, in attempting to work as at other times, I found my strength so exhausted as to render me entirely unable. My father, who was laboring along with me, discovered something to be wrong with me, and told me to go home. I started with the intention of going to the house; but, in attempting to cross the fence out of the field where we were, my strength entirely failed me, and I fell helpless on the ground, and for a time was quite unconscious of anything.
“The first thing that I can recollect was a voice speaking unto me, calling me by name. I looked up, and beheld the same messenger standing over my head, surrounded by light as before. He then again related unto me all that he had related to me the previous night, and commanded me to go to my father and tell him of the vision and commandments which I had received.
“*T obeyed; I returned to my father in the field, and rehearsed the whole matter to him. He replied to me that it was of God, and told me to go and do as commanded by the messenger. I left the field, and went to the place where the messenger had told me the plates were deposited; and owing to the distinctness of the vision which I had had concerning it, I knew the place the instant that I arrived there.
‘‘Convenient to the village of Manchester, Ontario county, New York, stands a hill of considerable size, and the most elevated of any in the neigh- borhood. On the west side of this hill, not far from the top, under a stone
of considerable size, lay the plates, deposited in a stone box. This stone was thick and rounding in the middle on the upper side, and thinner towards the edges, so that the middle part of it was visible above the ground, but the edge all around*was covered with earth.
“Having removed the earth, I obtained a lever, which I got fixed under the edge of the stone, and with a little exertion raised it up. I looked in, and there indeed did I behold the plates, the Urim and Thummim, and the breastplate, as stated by the messenger. The box in which they lay was formed by laying stones together in some kind of cement. In the bottom of the box were laid two stones crossways of the box, and on these stones lay the plates and the other things with them.
‘I made an attempt to take them out, but was forbidden by the mes- senger, and was again informed that the time for bringing them forth had not yet arrived, neither would it, until four years from that time; but he told me that I should come to that place precisely in one year from that time, and that he would there meet with me, and that I should continue to do so until the time should come for obtaining the plates.
“ Accordingly, as I had been commanded, I went at the end of each year, and at each time I found the same messenger there, and received instruc- tion and intelligence from him at each of our interviews, respecting what the Lord was going to do, and how and in what manner His kingdom was to be conducted in the last days.
CR Ook KK, KR
**At length the time arrived for obtaining the plates, the Urim and Thummim, and the breastplate. On the twenty-second day of September, one thousand eight hundred and twenty-seven, having gone as usual at the end of another year to the place where they were deposited, the same heavenly messenger delivered them up to me with this charge: That I should be responsible for them; that if I should let them go carelessly, or through any neglect of mine, I should be cut off; but that if I would use all my endeavors to preserve them, until he, the messenger, should call for them, they should be protected.
**T soon found out the reason why I had received such strict charges to keep them safe, and why it was that the messenger had said that when I had done what was required at my hand, he would call for them. For no sooner was it known that I had them, than the most strenuous exertions were used to get them from me. Every stratagem that could be invented was resorted to for that purpose. The persecution became more bitter and severe than before, and multitudes were on the alert continually to get them from me if possible. But by the wisdom of God, they remained safe in my hands, until I had accomplished by them what was required at my hand. When, according to arrangements, the messenger called for them, I delivered them up to him; and he has them in his charge until this day, being the second day of May, one thousand eight hundred and thirty-eight.”
For the complete record, see Joseph Smith—History, in the Pearl of Great Price, and History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, volume 1, chapters 1 through 6.
The ancient record thus brought forth from the earth as the voice of a people speaking from the dust, and translated into modern speech by the gift and power of God as attested by Divine affirmation, was first published to the world in the year 1830 as THE BOOK OF MORMON.
A BRIEF EXPLANATION ABOUT THE BOOK OF MORMON
The Book of Mormon is a sacred record of peoples in ancient America, and was engraved upon sheets of metal. Four kinds of metal record plates are spoken of in the book itself:
1. The Plates of Nephi, which were of two kinds: the Small Plates and the Large Plates. The former were more particularly devoted to the spiritual matters and the ministry and teachings of the prophets, while the latter were occupied mostly by a secular history of the peoples concerned (1 Nephi 9: 2—4). From the time of Mosiah, how- ever, the large plates also included items of major spiritualimportance.
2. The Plates of Mormon, which consist of an abridgment by Mormon from the Large Plates of Nephi, with many commentaries. These plates also contained a continuation of the history by Mormon and additions by his son Moroni.
3. The Plates of Ether, which present a history of the Jaredites. This record was abridged by Moroni, who inserted comments of his-own and incorporated the record with the general history under the title ‘*Book of Ether.”’
4. The Plates of Brass brought by the people of Lehi from Jerusalem in 600 B.c. These contained ‘‘the five books of Moses,... And also a record of the Jews from the beginning,...down to the commence- ment of the reign of Zedekiah, king of Judah; And also the prophecies of the holy prophets’’ (1 Nephi 5: 11-13). Many quotations from these plates, citing Isaiah and other biblical and nonbiblical prophets, appear in the Book of Mormon.
The Book of Mormon comprises fifteen main parts or divisions, known, with one exception, as books, each designated by the name of its principal author. The first portion (the first six books, ending with Omni) is a translation from the Small Plates of Nephi. Between the books of Omni and Mosiah is an insert called The Words of Mormon. This insert connects the record en- graved on the Small Plates with Mormon’s abridgment of the Large Plates.
The longest portion, from Mosiah to Mormon, chapter 7, inclusive, is a translation of Mormon’s abridgment of the Large Plates of Nephi. The concluding portion, from Mormon, chapter 8, to the end of the volume, was engraved by Mormon’s son Moroni, who, after finishing the record of his father’s life, made an abridgment of the Jaredite record (as the Book of Ether) and later added the parts known as the Book of Moroni.
In or about the year A.D. 421, Moroni, the last of the Nephite prophet- historians, sealed the sacred record and hid it up unto the Lord, to be brought forth in the latter days, as predicted by the voice of God through his ancient prophets. In A.D. 1823, this same Moroni, then a resurrected personage, visited the Prophet Joseph Smith and subsequently delivered the engraved plates to him.
About this edition: Some minor errors in the text have been perpetuated in past editions of the Book of Mormon. This edition contains corrections that seem appropriate to bring the material into conformity with prepublication manuscripts and early editions edited by the Prophet Joseph Smith.

THE FIRST BOOK OF NEPHI
HIS REIGN AND MINISTRY
An account of Lehi and his wife Sariah, and his four sons, being called, (begin- ning at the eldest) Laman, Lemuel, Sam, and Nephi. The Lord warns Lehi to depart out of the land of Jerusalem, because he prophesieth unto the people concerning their iniquity and they seek to destroy his life. He taketh three days’ journey into the wilderness with his family. Nephi taketh his brethren and returneth to the land of Jerusalem after the record of the Jews. The account of their sufferings. They take the daughters of Ishmael to wife. They take their families and depart into the wilderness. Their sufferings and afflictions in the wilderness. The course of their travels. They come to the large waters. Nephi’s brethren rebel against him. He confoundeth them, and buildeth a ship. They call the name of the place Bountiful. They cross the large waters into the promised land, and so forth. This is according to the account of Nephi; or in other words, I,
Nephi, wrote this record.
CHAPTER 1
Nephi begins the record of his people—Lehi sees in vision a pillar of fire and reads from a book of prophecy —He praises God, foretells the coming of the Messiah, and prophesies the destruction of Jerusalem—He is persecuted by the Jews.
» NEPHI, having been “born if of "goodly ‘parents, therefore I was “taught somewhat in all the learning of my father; and having seen many “afflictions in the course of my days, nevertheless, having been highly favored of the Lord in all my days; yea, having had a great knowledge of the goodness and the mysteries of God, therefore I make
a /record of my proceedings in my days.

with all his “heart, in behalf of his people.
6 And it came to pass as he prayed unto the Lord, there came a “pillar of fire and dwelt upon a rock before him; and he saw and heard much; and because of the things which he saw and heard he did ’quake and tremble exceedingly.
7 And it came to pass that he re- turned to his own house at Jeru- salem; and he cast himself upon his bed, being “overcome with the Spirit and the things which he had seen.
8 And being thus overcome with the Spirit, he was carried away ina “vision, even that he saw the *heavens open, and he thought he ‘saw God sitting upon his throne, surrounded with numberless con- courses of angels in the attitude of singing and praising their God.
9 And it came to pass that he saw One descending out of the midst of heaven, and he beheld that his “luster was above that of the sun at noon-day.
10 And he also saw “twelve others following him, and their brightness did exceed that of the stars in the firmament.
11 And they came down and went forth upon the face of the earth; and the first came and “stood before my father, and gave unto him a >book, and bade him that he should read.
12 And it came to pass that as he
Z
read, he was filled with the “Spirit of the Lord.
13 And he read, saying: Wo, wo, unto Jerusalem, for I have seen thine “abominations! Yea, and many things did my father read concerning °Jerusalem—that it should be destroyed, and the in- habitants thereof; many should perish by the sword, and many should be ‘carried away captive into Babylon.
14 And it came to pass that when my father had read and seen many great and marvelous things, he did exclaim many things unto the Lord; such as: Great and marvelous are thy works, O Lord God Almighty ! Thy throne is high in the heavens, and thy “power, and goodness, and mercy are over all the inhabitants of the earth; and, because thou art merciful, thou wilt not suffer those who ’come unto thee that they shall perish!
15 And after this manner was the language of my father in the praising of his God; for his soul did rejoice, and his whole heart was filled, be- cause of the things which he had seen, yea, which the Lord had shown unto him.
16 And now I, Nephi, do not make a full account of the things which my father hath written, for he hath written many things which he saw in “visions and in °dreams; and he also hath written many things which he ‘prophesied and spake

unto his children, of which I shall not make a full account.
17 But I shall make-an account of my proceedings in my days. Behold, I make an “abridgment of the record of my °father, upon ‘plates which I have made with mine own hands; wherefore, after I have abridged the record of my “father then will I make an account of mine own life.
18 Therefore, I would that ye should know, that after the Lord had shown so many marvelous things unto my father, Lehi, yea, concerning the “destruction of Jeru- salem, behold he went forth among the people, and began to ’prophesy and to declare unto them concerning the things which he had both seen and heard.
19 And it came to pass that the “Jews did ’mock him because of the things which he testified of them; for he truly testified of their “wicked- ness and their abominations; and he testified that the things which he saw and heard, and also the things which he read in the book, mani- fested plainly of the coming of a 4Messiah, and also the redemption of the world.
20 And when the Jews heard these things they were angry with him; yea, even as with the prophets of old, whom they had “cast out, and stoned, and slain; and they also ’sought his life, that they might take it away. But behold, I, Nephi, will show unto you that the tender ‘mercies of the Lord are over all

CHAPTER 2
Lehi takes his family into the wilder- ness by the Red Sea—They leave their property—Lehi offers a sacrifice to the Lord and teaches his sons to keep the commandments—Lamanand Lemuel murmur against their father—Nephi is obedient and prays in faith; the Lord speaks to him, and he is chosen to rule over his brethren.
For behold, it came to pass that the Lord spake unto my father, yea, even in a dream, and said unto him: Blessed art thou Lehi, because of the things which thou hast done; and because thou hast been faithful and declared unto this people the things which I commanded thee, behold, they seek to “take away thy °life.
2 And it came to pass that the Lord “commanded my father, even in a *dream, that he should ‘take his family and depart into the wilder- ness.
3 And it came to pass that he was “obedient unto the word of the Lord, wherefore he did as the Lord com- manded him.
4 And it came to pass that “he *departed into the wilderness. And he left his house, and the land of his inheritance, and his gold, and his silver, and his precious things, and took nothing with him, save it

were his family, and provisions, and tents, and departed into the wilder- ness.
5 And he came down by the borders near the shore of the *Red Sea; and he traveled in the wilder- ness in the borders which are nearer the Red Sea; and he did travel in the wilderness with his family, which consisted of my mother, Sariah, and my elder brothers, who were Laman, Lemuel, and Sam.
6 And it came to pass that when he had traveled three days in the wilder- ness, he pitched his tent in a °valley by the side of a "river of water.
7 And it came to pass that he built an “altar of "stones, and made an ‘offering unto the Lord, and gave 4thanks unto the Lord our God.
8 And it came to pass that he called the name of the river, Laman, and it emptied into the Red Sea; and the valley was in the borders near the mouth thereof.
9 And when my father saw that the waters of the river emptied into the “fountain of the Red Sea, he spake unto Laman, saying: O that thou mightest be like unto this river, continually running into the foun- tain of all righteousness !
10 And he also spake unto Lemuel: O that thou mightest be like unto this valley, “firm and "steadfast, and immovable in keeping the command- ments of the Lord!
11 Now this he spake because of the “stiffmeckedness of Laman and
4
Lemuel; for behold they did °mur- mur in many things against their ‘father, because he was a “visionary man, and had led them out of the land of Jerusalem, to leave the land of their inheritance, and their gold, and their silver, and their precious things, to perish in the wilderness. And this they said he had done because of the foolish imaginations of his heart.
12 And thus Laman and Lemuel, being the eldest, did murmur against their “father. And they did *murmur because they “knew not the deal- ings of that God who had ‘created them.
13 Neither did they “believe that Jerusalem, that great city, could be *destroyed according to the words of the prophets. And they were like unto the Jews who were at Jeru- salem, who sought to take away the life of my father.
14 And it came to pass that my father did speak unto them in the “valley of Lemuel, with °power, being filled with the Spirit, until their frames did ‘shake before him. And he did confound them, that they durst not utter against him; wherefore, they did as he com- manded them.
15 And my father dwelt in a “tent.
16 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, being exceedingly young, nevertheless being large in stature, and also having great desires to know of the “mysteries of God,

wherefore, I did cry unto the Lord; and behold he did °visit me, and did ‘soften my heart that-I did “believe all the words which had been spoken by my “father; wherefore, I did not ‘rebel against him like unto my brothers.
17 And I spake unto Sam, making known unto him the things which the Lord had manifested unto me by his Holy Spirit. And it came to pass that he believed in my words.
18 But, behold, Laman and Lemuel would not hearken unto my words; and being “grieved because of the hardness of their hearts I cried unto the Lord for them.
19 And it came to pass that the Lord spake unto me, saying: Blessed art thou, Nephi, because of thy ‘faith, for thou hast sought me diligently, with lowliness of heart.
20 And inasmuch as ye shall keep my commandments, ye shall *pros- per, and shall be led to a "land of promise; yea, even a land which I have prepared for you; yea, a land which is choice above all other lands.
21 And inasmuch as thy brethren shall rebel against thee, they shall be “cut off from the presence of the Lord.
22 And inasmuch as thou shalt keep my commandments, thou shalt be made a “ruler and a teacher over thy brethren.
23 For behold, in that day that they shall “rebel against me, I will >curse them even with a sore curse, and they shall have no power over
1 NEPHI 2:17-3:5
thy seed except they shall ‘rebel against me also.
24 And if it so be that they rebel against me, they shall be a “scourge unto thy seed, to “stir them up in the ways of remembrance.
CHAPTER 3
Lehi’s sons return to Jerusalem to obtain the plates of brass—Laban refuses to give them up—Nephi exhorts and encourages his brethren— Laban steals their property and attempts to slay them—Laman and Lemuel smite Nephi and are reproved by an angel.
AND it came to pass that I, Nephi, returned from “speaking with the Lord, to the tent of my father.
2 And it came to pass that he spake unto me, saying: Behold I have dreamed a “dream, in the which the Lord hath commanded me that thou and thy brethren shall ’return to Jerusalem.
3 For behold, Laban hath the record of the Jews and also a “genealogy of my forefathers, and they are "engraven upon plates of brass.
4 Wherefore, the Lord hath com- manded me that thou and thy brothers should go unto the house of Laban, and seek the records, and bring them down hither into the wilderness.

them, but it is a commandment of the Lord.
6 Therefore go, my son, and thou shalt be favored of the Lord, because thou hast “not ’murmured.
7 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said unto my father: I “will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, for I know that the Lord giveth no °commandments unto the children of men, save he shall ‘prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them.
8 And it came to pass that when my father had heard these words he was exceedingly glad, for he knew that I had been blessed of the Lord.
9 And I, Nephi, and my brethren took our journey in the wilderness, with our tents, to go up to the land of Jerusalem.
10 And it came to pass that when we had gone up to the land of Jerusalem, I and my brethren did consult one with another.
11 And we “cast lots—who of us should goin unto the house of Laban. And it came to pass that the lot fell upon Laman; and Laman went in unto the house of Laban, and he taiked with him as he sat in his house.
12 And he desired of Laban the records which were engraven upon the plates of brass, which contained the “genealogy of my father.
13 And behold, it came to pass that Laban was angry, and thrust him out from his presence; and he would not that he should have the records. Wherefore, hesaid untohim: Behold thou art a robber, and I will slay thee.

14 But Laman fled out of his presence, and told the things which Laban had done, unto us. And we began to be exceedingly sorrowful, and my brethren were about to return unto my father in the wilder- ness.
15 But behold I said unto them that: “As the Lord liveth, and as we live, we will not go down unto our father in the wilderness until we have "accomplished the thing which the Lord hath commanded us.
16 Wherefore, let us be faithful in keeping the commandments of the Lord; therefore let us go down to the land of our father’s “inheritance, for behold he left gold and silver, and all manner of riches. And all this he hath done because of the °command- ments of the Lord.
17 For he knew that Jerusalem must be “destroyed, because of the wickedness of the people.
18 For behold, they have “rejected the words of the prophets. Where- fore, if my father should dwell in the land after he hath been ’commanded to flee out of the land, behold, he would also perish. Wherefore, it must needs be that he flee out of the land.
19 And behold, it is wisdom in God that we should obtain these “records, that we may preserve unto our children the language of our fathers;
20 And also that we may “preserve unto them the words which have been spoken by the mouth of all the holy °prophets, which have been delivered unto them by the Spirit and power of God, since the world began, even down unto this present | time.

21 And it came to pass that after this manner of language did I “persuade my brethren, that they might be faithful in keeping the com- mandments of God.
22 And it came to pass that we went down to the land of our inheritance, and we did gather together our ¢gold, and our silver, and our precious things.
23 And after we had gathered these things together, we went up again unto the house of Laban.
24 And it came to pass that we went in unto Laban, and desired him that he would give unto us the records which were engraven upon the plates of brass, for which we would give unto him our gold, and our silver, and all our precious things.
25 And it came to pass that when Laban saw our property, and that it was exceedingly great, he did “lust after it, insomuch that he thrust us out, and sent his servants to slay us, that he might obtain our property.
26 And “it came to pass that we did flee before the servants of Laban, and we were obliged to leave behind our property, and it fell into the hands of Laban.
27 And it came to pass that we fled into the wilderness, and the servants of Laban did not overtake us, and we “hid ourselves in the cavity of a rock.
28 And it came to pass that Laman was angry with me, and also with my father; and also was Lemuel, for he hearkened unto the words of Laman. Wherefore Laman and Lemuel did speak many “hard words unto us, their younger brothers, and they did smite us even with a rod.

Know ye not that the Lord hath chosen him to be a "ruler over you, and this because of your iniquities? Behold ye shall go up to Jerusalem again, and the Lord will ‘deliver Laban into your hands.
30 And after the “angel had spoken unto us, he departed.
31 And after the angel had de- parted, Laman and Lemuel again began to *murmur, saying: How is it possible that the Lord will deliver Laban into our hands? Behold, he is a mighty man, and he can command fifty, yea, even he can slay fifty; then why not us?

3 Now behold ye know that this is true; and ye also know that an “angel hath spoken unto you ; where- fore can ye "doubt? Let us go up; the Lord is able to ‘deliver us, even as our fathers, and to destroy Laban, even as the Egyptians.
4 Now when I had spoken these words, they were yet wroth, and did still continue to murmur; neverthe- less they did follow me up until we came without the walls of Jerusalem.
5 And it was by night; and I caused that they should hide themselves without the walls. And after they had hid themselves, I, Nephi, crept into the city and went forth towards the house of Laban.
6 And I was “led by the Spirit, not *knowing beforehand the things which I should do.
7 Nevertheless I went forth, and as I came near unto the house of Laban I beheld a man, and he had fallen to the earth before me, for he was “drunken with wine.
8 And when I came to him I found that it was Laban.
9 And I beheld his “sword, and I drew it forth from the sheath there- of; and the hilt thereof was of pure gold, and the workmanship thereof was exceedingly fine, and I saw that the blade thereof was of the most precious steel.
10 And it came to pass that I was “constrained by the Spirit that I should kill Laban; but I said in my heart: Never at any time have I shed the blood of man. And I shrunk and would that I might not slay him.

11 And the Spirit said unto me again: Behold the “Lord hath | >delivered him into thy hands. Yea, and I also knew that he had sought to take away mine own life; yea, and he would not hearken unto the commandments of the Lord; and he also had ‘taken away our property.
12 And it came to pass that the | Spirit said unto me again: Slay him, for the Lord hath delivered him into | thy hands;
13 Behold the Lord “slayeth the >wicked to bring forth his righteous purposes. It is “better that one man should perish than that a nation should dwindle and perish in 4unbelief.
14 And now, when I, Nephi, had heard these words, I remembered the words of the Lord which he spake unto me in the wilderness, saying that: “Inasmuch as thy seed shall keepmy commandments, they shall ‘prosper in the “land of promise.
15 Yea, and I also thought that they could not keep the command- ments of the Lord according to the “law of Moses, save they should have the law.
16 And I also knew that the “law was engraven upon the plates of brass. |
17 And again, I knew that the Lord had delivered Laban into my hands | for this cause—that I might obtain the records according to his com- mandments.
18 Therefore I did obey the voice of the Spirit, and took Laban by the hair of the head, and I smote off his | head with his own “sword.

head with his own sword, I took the garments of Laban and put them upon mine own body; yea, even every whit; and I did gird on his armor about my loins.
20 And after I had done this, Lwent forth unto the treasury of Laban. And as I went forth towards the treasury of Laban, behold, I saw the “servant of Laban who had the keys of the treasury. And I com- manded him in the voice of Laban, that he should go with me into the treasury.
21 And he supposed me to be his master, Laban, for he beheld the garments and also the sword girded about my loins.
22 And he spake unto me concern- ing the “elders of the Jews, he know- ing that his master, Laban, had been out by night among them.
23 And I spake unto him as if ithad been Laban.
24 And I also spake unto him that Ishould carry the engravings, which were upon the “plates of brass, to my elder brethren, who were with- out the walls.
25 And I also bade him that he should follow me.
26 And he, supposing that I spake of the “brethren of the ’church, and that I was truly that Laban whom I had slain, wherefore he did follow
me.
27 And he spake unto me many times concerning the elders of the Jews, as I went forth untomy breth- ren, who were without the walls.
28 And it came to pass that when Laman saw me he was exceedingly frightened, and also Lemuel and Sam. And they fled from before my presence; for they supposed it -was Laban, and that he had slain me and had sought to take away their lives also.
29 And it came to pass that I called

after them, and they did hear me; wherefore they did cease to flee from my presence.
30 And it came to pass that when the servant of Laban beheld my brethren he began to tremble, and was about to flee from before me and return to the city of Jerusalem.
31 And now I, Nephi, being a man large in stature, and also having received much “strength of the Lord, therefore I did seize upon the ser- vant of Laban, and held him, that he should not flee.
32 And it came to pass that I spake with him, that if he would hearken unto my words, as the Lord liveth, and as I live, even so that if he would hearken unto our words, we would spare his life:
33 And I spake unto him, even with an “oath, that he need not fear; that he should be a "free man like unto us if he would go down in the wilderness with us.
34 And I also’spake unto him, say- ing: Surely the Lord hath *%com- manded ‘us to do this thing; and shall we not be diligent in keeping the commandments of the Lord? Therefore, if thou wilt go down into the wilderness to my father thou shalt have place with us.
35 And it came to pass that *Zoram did take courage at the words which I spake. Now Zoram was the name of the servant; and he promised that he would go down into the wilder- ness unto our father. Yea, and he also made an oath unto us that he would tarry with us from that time forth.
36 Now we were desirous that he should tarry with us for this cause, that the Jews might not know con- cerning our flight into the wilder- ness, lest they should pursue us and destroy us.

Zoram had made an “oath unto us, our fears did cease concerning him.
38 And it came to pass that we took the plates of brass and the servant of Laban; and departed into the wilderness, and journeyed unto the “tent of our father.
CHAPTER '5
Sariah complains against Lehi—Both rejoice over the return of their sons— They offer sacrifices—The plates of brass contain writings of Moses and the prophets—They identify Lehi as a descendant of Joseph—Lehi prophe- sies concerning his seed and_ the preservation of the plates.
AND it came to pass that after we had come down into > the wilder- ness unto our father, behold, he was filled with joy, and alsomy mother, Sariah, was exceedingly glad, for she truly had mourned because of us.
2 For she had supposed that we had perished in the wilderness; and she also had “complained against my father, telling him that he was a bvisionary man; saying : Behold thou hast led us forth from the land of our inheritance, and my soms are no more, and we perish in the wilder- ness.
3 And after this manner of language had my mother complained against my father.
4 And it had come to pass that my father spake unto her, saying: I know that I am a “visionary man; for if I had not seen the things of God in a °vision I should not have known the goodness of God, but had tarried at Jerusalem, and had perished with my brethren.

»land of promise, in the which things
I do rejoice; yea, and I “know that
the Lord will deliver my sons out of the hands of Laban; and bring them down again unto usin the wilderness.
6 And after this manner of language did my father, Lehi, “comfort my mother, Sariah, concerning us, while we journeyed in the wilderness up to
the land of Jerusalem, to obtain the |
record of the Jews.
7 And when we had returned to the tent of my father, behold their joy was full, and my mother was comforted.
8 And she spake, saying: Now 1 know of a surety that the Lord hath “commanded my husband to flee into the wilderness; yea, and I also
know of a surety that the Lord hath |
protected my sons, and delivered them out of the hands of Laban, and given them power whereby they could ‘accomplish the thing which the Lord hath commanded them. And after this manner of language did she speak.
9 And it came to pass that they did rejoice exceedingly, and did offer
‘sacrifice and burnt offerings unto _
the Lord; and they gave ’thanks un- to the God of Israel. 10 And after they had given thanks
unto the God of Israel, my father, |
Lehi, took the records which were engraven upon the “plates of brass,
and he did search them from the |
beginning.
11 And he beheld that they did contain the five “books of Moses, which gave an account of the crea- tion of the world, and also of Adam and Eve, who were our first parents ;

12 And also a “record of the Jews from the beginning, even down to the commencement of-the reign of Zedekiah, king of Judah;
13 And also the prophecies of the holy prophets, from the beginning, even down to the commencement of the reign of “Zedekiah; and also many prophecies which have been spoken by the mouth of ’ Jeremiah.
14 And it came to: pass that my father, Lehi, also found upon the “plates of brass a “genealogy of his °fathers; wherefore he knew that he was a descendant of “Joseph; yea, even that Joseph who was the son of ‘Jacob, who was ‘sold into Egypt, and who was ‘preserved by the hand of the Lord, that he might pre- serve his father, Jacob, and all his household from perishing with famine.
15 And they were also “led out of captivity and out of the land of Egypt, by that same God who had preserved them.
16 And thus my father, Lehi, did discover the genealogy of his fathers. And Laban also was a descendant of * Joseph, wherefore he and his fathers had kept the "records.
17 And now when my father saw all these things, he was filled with the Spirit, and began to prophesy concerning his seed—
18 That these “plates of brass should go forth unto all ’nations, kindreds, tongues, and people who were of his seed.
19 Wherefore, he said that these

20 And it came to pass that thus far I and my father had kept the commandments wherewith the Lord had commanded us.
21 And we had obtained the records which the Lord. had com- manded us, and searched them and found that they were desirable; yea, even of great “worth unto us, in- somuch that we could “preserve the commandments of the Lord unto our children.
22 Wherefore, it was wisdom in the Lord that we should carry them with uS, as we journeyed in the wilderness towards the land of promise.

Lehi’s sons return to Jerusalem and enlist Ishmael and his household in their cause—Laman_and others rebel —Nephi exhorts his brethren to have faith in the Lord—They bind him with cords and plan his destruction—He is freed by the power of faith—His brethren ask forgiveness—Lehi and his company offer sacrifice and burnt offerings.
AND now I would that ye might know, that. after my father, Lehi, had made an end of “prophesying concerning his seed, it came to pass that the Lord spake unto him again, saying that it was not meet for him, Lehi, that he should take his family into the wilderness alone; but that his sons should take °daughters.to ‘wife, that they might raise up 4seed unto the Lord in the land of promise.

Jerusalem, and bring down Ishmael | and his family into the wilderness.
3 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did “again, withmy brethren, go forth into the wilderness to go up
| to Jerusalem.
4 And it came to pass that we went up unto the house of Ishmael, and we did gain favor in the sight of Ishmael, insomuch that we did | speak unto him the words. of the | Lord. ;
5 Andit came to pass that the*Lord did soften the heart of Ishmael, and also his household, insomuch-that | they took their journey with us down into the wilderness to the tent | of our father.
6 And it came to pass that as we | journeyed in the wilderness, behold Laman and Lemuel, and two of the 2daughters of Ishmael, and the two | ’sons of Ishmael and their families, did ‘rebel against us; yea, against me, Nephi, and Sam, and their father, Ishmael, and his wife, and his three other daughters.
7 And it came to pass in the which rebellion, they were desirous to | return unto the land of Jerusalem.
8 And now I, Nephi, being “grieved for the hardness of their hearts, | therefore I spake unto them, saying, | yea, even unto Laman and unto Lemuel: Behold ye are mine elder | brethren, and how is it that ye are | so hard in your hearts, and so blind | in your minds, that ye have need that I, your “younger brother, | should speak unto you, yea, and set an ‘example for you?

11 Yea, and how is it that ye have forgotten what great things the Lord hath done for us, in “delivering us out of the hands of Laban, and also that we should obtain the record?
12 Yea, and how is it that ye have forgotten that the Lord is able to do all *things according to his will, for the children of men, if it so be that they exercise "faith in him? Where- fore, let us be faithful to him.
13 And if it so be that we are faithful to him, we shall obtain the “and of promise; and ye shall know at some future period that the word of the Lord shall be fulfilled con- cerning the destruction of °Jeru- salem; for all things which the Lord hath spoken concerning the destruc- tion of Jerusalem must be fulfilled.
14 For behold, the “Spirit of the Lord °ceaseth soon to strive with them; for behold, they have ‘re- jected the prophets, and 7Jeremiah have they cast into prison. And they have sought to take away the ‘life of my father, insomuch that they have driven him out of the land.
15 Now behold, I say unto you that if ye will return unto Jerusalem ye shall also perish with them. And now, if ye have choice, go up to the land, and remember the words which I speak unto you, that if ye go ye will also perish; for thus the Spirit of the Lord constraineth me that I should speak.
16 And it came to pass that when I, Nephi, had spoken these words unto my brethren, they were angry with me. And it came to pass that they did lay their hands upon me, for behold, they were exceedingly wroth, and they did “bind me with

17 But it came to pass that I prayed unto the Lord, saying: O Lord, according to my faith which
is in thee, wilt thou deliver me from
the hands of my brethren; yea, even give me “strength that I may "burst these bands with which I am bound.
18 And it came to pass that when I had said these words, behold, the bands were loosed from off my hands and feet, and I stood before my brethren, and I spake unto them again.
19 And it came to pass that they were angry with me again, and sought to lay hands upon me; but behold, one of the “daughters of Ishmael, yea, and also her mother, and one of the sons of Ishmael, did plead with my brethren, insomuch that they did soften their hearts; and they did cease striving to take away my life.
20 And it came to pass that they were sorrowful, because of their wickedness, insomuch that they did bow down before me, and did plead with me that I would “forgive them of the thing that they had done against me.
21 And it came to pass that I did frankly “forgive them all that they had done, and I did exhort them that they would pray unto the Lord their God for °forgiveness. And it came to pass that they did so. And after they had done praying unto the Lord we did again travel on our journey towards the tent of our father.

him. CHAPTER 8
Lehi sees a vision of the tree of life— He partakes of its fruit and desires his family to do likewise—He sees a rod of iron, a strait and narrow path, and the mists of darkness that enshroud men—Sariah, Nephi, and Sam par- take of the fruit, but Laman and Lemuel refuse.
AND it came to pass that we had gathered together all manner of “seeds of every kind, both of grain of every kind, and also of the seeds of fruit of every kind.
2 And it came to pass that while my father tarried in the wilderness he spake unto us, saying: Behold, I have “dreamed a dream; or, in other words, I have ’seen a ‘vision.
3 And behold, because of the thing which I have seen, I have-reason to rejoice in the Lord because of *Nephi and also of Sam; for I have reason to suppose that they, and also many of their seed, will be saved.
4 But behold, *7Laman and Lemuel, I fear exceedingly because of you; for behold, methought I saw in my dream, a dark anddreary wilderness.
5 And it came to pass that I saw a *man, and he was dressed in a white "robe; and he came and stood before me.
6 And it came to pass that he spake unto me, and bade me follow him.

_8 And after I had traveled for the space of many hours in darkness, I began to pray unto the Lord that he | would have “mercy on me, accord- ing to the multitude of his tender mercies.

11 And it came to pass that I did go forth and partake of the “fruit thereof; and I. beheld that it was | most. sweet, above all that I ever before tasted. Yea, and I beheld that the fruit thereof was white, to exceed all the "whiteness that I had ever seen.
12 And as I partook of the fruit thereof it filled my soul with exceed- ingly great “joy; wherefore, I began to be desirous that my family should partake of it also; for I knew } that it was ‘desirable above all other ° fruit.
13 And as I cast my eyes round about, that perhaps I might discover > my family also, I beheld a “river of ’ water; and it ran along, and it was} near the tree of which I was par-' taking the fruit.

beckoned unto them; and I also did say unto them with a loud voice that they should come unto me, and par- take of the fruit, which was desir- able above all other fruit.
16 And it came to pass that they did come unto me and partake of the fruit also.
17 And it came to pass that I was desirous that Laman and Lemuel should come and partake of the fruit also; wherefore, I cast mine eyes towards the head of the river, that perhaps I might see them.
18 And it came to pass that I saw them, but they would “not come unto me and partake of the fruit.
19 And I beheld a “rod of iron, and it extended along the bank of the river, and led to the tree by which I stood.
20 And I also beheld a ?strait and narrow path, which came along by the rod of iron, even to the tree by which I stood; and it also led by the head of the fountain, unto a large and spacious field, as if it had beena oworld.
21 And I saw numberless con- courses of people, many of whom were “pressing forward, that they might obtain the path which led unto the tree by which I stood.
22 And it came to pass that they did come forth, and commence in the path which led to the tree.

way, that they ‘wandered off and were "lost.
24 And it came to pass that I beheld others pressing forward, and. they came forth and caught hold of the end of the rod of iron; and they did press forward through the mist of darkness, “clinging to the rod of iron, even until they did come forth and partake of the fruit of the tree.
25 And after they had partaken of the fruit of the tree they did cast their eyes about as if they were “ashamed.
26 And I also cast my eyes round about, and beheld, on the “other side of the river of water, a great and ’spacious building; and it stood as it were in the ‘air, high above the earth.
27 And it was filled with people, both old and young, both male and female; and their manner of dress was exceedingly fine; and they were in the “attitude of "mocking and pointing their fingers towards those who had come at and were partaking of the fruit.
28 And after they had “tasted: of the fruit they were "ashamed, be- cause of those that were ‘scoffing at them; and they “fell away into forbidden paths and were lost.

31 And he also saw other “multi- tudes feeling their way towards that great and spacious building. f
32 And it came to pass that many were drowned in the “depths of the *fountain; and many were lost from his. view, wandering in strange roads.
33 And great was the multitude that did enter into that strange building. And after they did enter into that building they did point the finger of “scorn at me and those that were partaking of the fruit also; but we heeded them not.
34 These are the words of my father: For as many as “heeded them, had fallen away.
35 And *Laman and Lemuel par- took not of the fruit, said my father.
36 And it came to pass after my father had spoken all the words of his dream or vision, which were many, he said unto us, because of these things which he saw in a vision, he exceedingly feared for Laman and Lemuel; yea, he feared lest they should be cast off from the presence of the Lord.
37 And he did “exhort them then with all the feeling of a tender parent, that they would hearken to his words, that perhaps the Lord would be merciful to them, and not cast them off; yea, my father did preach unto them.
38 And after he had preached unto them, and also prophesied unto them of many things, he bade them

to keep the commandments’ ofthe Lord; and he did cease speaking unto them.
CHAPTER 9
Nephi makes two sets of records— Each is called the plates of Nephi— The larger plates contain a secular history; the smaller ones deal pri- marily with sacred things.
AND all these things did my father see, and hear, and speak, as he dwelt in a tent, in the “valley of Lemuel, and also a great many more things, which cannot be written upon these plates.
2 And now, as I have spoken con- cerning these plates, behold they are not the plates upon which I make a full account of the history of my people; for the “plates upon which I make a full account of my people I have given the name of Nephi; wherefore, they are called the plates of Nephi, after mine own name; and these plates also are called the plates of Nephi.
3 Nevertheless, I have received a commandment of the Lord that I should make these plates, for the special “purpose that there should be an account engraven of the ’ministry of my people.
4 Upon the other plates should be engraven an account of the reign of the kings, and the wars and con- tentions of my people; wherefore these plates are for the more part of the ministry; and the “other plates are for the more part of the reign of the kings and the wars and con- tentions of my people.

CHAPTER 10
Lehi predicts the Babylonian captivity —He tells of the coming among the Jews of a Messiah, a Savior, a Re- deemer—Re tells also of the coming of the one who should baptize the Lamb of God—Lehi tells of the death and resurrection of the Messiah—He com- pares the scattering and gathering of Israel to an olive tree—Nephi speaks of the Son of God, of the gift of the Holy Ghost, and of the need for righteous- ness.
AND now I, Nephi, proceed to give an account upon “these plates of my proceedings, and my reign and ministry ; wherefore, to proceed with mine account, I must speak some- what of the things of my father, and also of my brethren.
2 For behold, it came to pass after my father had made an end of speak- ing the words of his “dream, and also of exhorting them to all diligence, he spake unto them con- cerning the Jews—

3 That after they should be de- stroyed, even that great city “Jeru- salem, and many be ’carried away captive into “Babylon, according to the own due time of the Lord, they should ‘return again, yea, even be brought back out of captivity; and
| after they should be brought back
out of captivity they should possess again the land of their inheritance.
4 Yea, even “six hundred years from the time that my father left Jerusalem, a "prophet would the Lord God raise up among the °Jews —even a “Messiah, or, in other words, a Savior of the world.
5 And he also spake concerning the prophets, how great a number had “testified of these things, concerning this Messiah, of whom he had spo- ken, or this Redeemer of the world.
6 Wherefore, all mankind were in a “lost and ina °fallen state, and ever would be save they should rely on this Redeemer.
7 And he spake also concerning a “prophet. who should come. before the Messiah, to prepare the way of the Lord—
8 Yea, even he should go forth and cry in the wilderness: “Prepare ye the way of the Lord, and make his paths straight; for there standeth one among you whom ye know not; and he is mightier than I, whose shoe’s latchet I am not worthy to unloose: And much spake my father concerning this thing.

10 And after he had baptized the Messiah with water, he should be- hold and bear record that he had baptized the “Lamb of God, who should take away the sins of the world.
11 And it came to pass after my father had spoken ‘these words he spake unto my brethren concerning the gospel which should be preached among the Jews, and also concern- ing the “dwindling of the Jews in bunbelief. And after they had “slain the Messiah, who should come, and after he had been slain he should “rise from the dead, and should make himself “manifest, by the Holy Ghost, unto the Gentiles.
12 Yea, even my father spake much concerning the Gentiles, and also concerning the house of Israel, that they should be compared like unto an “olive-tree, whose "branches should be broken off and should be ‘scattered upon all the face of the earth.
13 Wherefore, he said it must needs be that we should be led with one accord into the “land of promise, unto the fulfilling of the word of the Lord, that we should be scattered upon all the face of the earth.

14 And after the house of “Israel should be scattered they should be beathered together again; or, in fine, after the “Gentiles had received the fulness of the “Gospel, the natural branches of the “olive-tree, or the ‘remnants of the house of ‘Israel, should be grafted in, or “come to the knowledge of the true Messiah, their Lord and their Redeemer.
15 And after this manner of language did my father prophesy and speak unto my brethren, and also many more things which I do not write in this book; for I have written as many. of. them as were expedient for me in mine “other book.
16 And all these things, of which I have spoken, were done as my father dwelt in a “tent, in the valley of Lemuel.
17 And it came to pass after I, Nephi, having heard all the “words of my father, concerning the things which he saw in a °vision, and also the things which he spake by the power of the Holy Ghost, which power he received by faith on the Son of God—and the Son of God was the ‘Messiah who should come— I, Nephi, was @desirous also that I might see, and hear, and know of these things, by the power of the ‘Holy Ghost, which is the “gift of God unto Yall those who diligently seek him, as well in times of "old

Nephi sees the Spirit of the Lord and is shown in vision the tree of life—He sees the mother of the Son of God and learns of the condescension of God— He sees the baptism, ministry, and crucifixion of the Lamb of God—He sees also the call.and ministry. of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.

For it. came to pass-after I had desired to know the things that my father had seen, and believing that the Lord was able to make them known unto me, as I sat *pondering in mine heart I was °caught away in the Spirit of the Lord, yea, into an exceedingly high “mountain, which I never had before seen, and upon which I never had beforeset my foot.
2 And the Spirit said unto me: Behold, what “desirest thou?
3 And I said: I desire to behold the things which my father “saw.
4 And the Spirit said unto me: “Believest thou that thy father saw the, tree of which he hath spoken?
5 And I said: Yea, thou knowest that I “believe all the words of my father.
6 And when I had spoken these words, the Spirit cried with a loud voice, saying: Hosanna to the Lord, the most high God; for he is God over all the “earth, yea, even above all. And blessed art thou, Nephi, because thou "believest in the Son of the most high God; wherefore, thou shalt behold the things which thou hast desired.
7 And behold this thing shall be given unto thee for a “sign, that after thou hast beheld the tree which bore the fruit which thy father tasted, thou shalt also, behold. a man de- scending out of heaven, and him shall ye witness; and after ye have witnessed him ye shall °bear record that it is the Son of God.

9 And it came to pass after I had seen the tree, I said unto the Spirit: I behold thou hast shown unto me the tree which is “precious above all.
10 And he said unto me: What desirest thou?
11 And I said unto him: To know the “interpretation thereof—for I spake unto him as a man speaketh; for I beheld that he was in the ’form of a man; yet nevertheless, I knew that it was the Spirit of the Lord; and he spake unto me as a man speaketh with another.
12 And it came to pass that he said unto me: Look! And I looked as if to look upon him, and Isaw him not; for he had gone from beforemy presence.
13 And it came to pass that I looked and beheld the great city of Jerusalem, and also other cities. And I beheld the city of Nazareth; and in the city of “Nazareth I beheld a >virgin, and she was exceedingly fair and white.
14 And it came to pass that I saw the “heavens open; and an angel came down and stood before me; and he said unto me: Nephi, what beholdest thou?

that he loveth his children; never- theless, I do not know the meaning of all things.
18 And he said unto me: Behold, the “virgin whom thou seest is the | mother of the Son of God, after the manner of the flesh.
19 And it came to pass that I | beheld that she was carried away in the Spirit; and after she had been | carried away in the “Spirit for the | space of a time the angel spake unto me, saying: Look!
20 And I looked and ‘beheld the ||
virgin again, bearing a “child in her arms.
21 And the angel said unto me: Behold the “Lamb of God, yea, even the °Son of the Eternal ‘Father! Knowest thou the meaning of the “tree which thy father saw?

23 And he spake unto me, saying: | Yea, and the most “joyous to the soul.
24 And after he had said these words, he said unto me: Look! And I looked, and I beheld the Son of | God “going forth among the children of men; and I saw many fall down | at his feet and worship him.

30 And it came to pass that the angel spake unto me again, saying: Look! And I looked, and I beheld the heavens open again, and I saw “angels descending upon the children of men; and they did minister unto them.
31 And he spake unto me again, saying: Look! And I looked, and I beheld the Lamb of God going forth among the children of men. And I beheld multitudes of people who

Nephi sees in vision: the land of promise; the righteousness, iniquity, and downfall of its inhabitants; the coming of the Lamb of God among them ; how the twelve disciples and the twelve apostles shall judge Israel ; the loathsome and filthy state of those who dwindle in unbelief.
AND it came to pass that the angel said unto me: Look, and behold thy seed, and also the seed of thy brethren. And I Jooked and beheld the “land of promise; and I beheld multitudes of people, yea, even as it were in number as many as the ’sand of the sea.
2 And it came to pass that I beheld multitudes gathered together to battle, one against the other; and I beheld ?wars, and rumors of wars, and great slaughters with the sword among my people.
3 And it came to pass that I beheld many generations pass away, after the manner of wars and contentions in theland; and I beheld many cities, yea, even that I did not number them.
4 And it came to pass that Isawa “mist of darkness on the face of the land of promise; and I saw light- nings, and I heard thunderings, and earthquakes, and all manner of tumultuous noises; and I saw the earth and the rocks, that they rent; and I saw mountains tumbling into

pieces; and I saw the plains of the earth, that they were ‘broken up; and I saw many cities that they were 4sunk; and I saw many that they were burned with fire; and I saw many that did tumble to the earth, because of the quaking thereof.
5 And it came to pass after I saw) these things, I saw the “vapor of darkness, that it passed from off the face of the earth; and behold, I saw multitudes who had not fallen be- cause of the great and terrible judg-¥ ments of the Lord.
6 And I saw the heavens open, and) the “Lamb of God descending out of! heaven; and he came down and) ’showed himself unto them.
7 And I also saw and bear record that the Holy Ghost fell. upon "twelve others; and they were or- dained of God, and chosen.

19 And while the angel spake these words, I beheld and saw that the seed of my brethren did contend against my seed, according to the word of the angel; and because of the pride of my seed, and the “temptations of the devil, I beheld that the seed of my brethren did ’overpower the people of my seed.
20 And ‘it came to pass that I be- held, and saw the people of the seed of my brethren that they had over- come my seed; and they went forth in multitudes upon the face of the land.
21 And I saw them gathered together in multitudes; and I saw *wars and rumors of wars among them; and in wars and rumors of wars I saw "many generations pass away.
22 And the angel said unto me: Behold these shall “dwindle in un- belief.
23 And it came to pass that I be- held, after they had dwindled in unbelief they became a “dark, and loathsome, and a °filthy people, full of ‘idleness and all manner of abominations.

2 And the angel said unto me: What beholdest thou? And I said: I behold.many “nations and king- doms.
3 And he said unto me: These are the nations and kingdoms of the Gentiles.
4 And it came to pass that I saw among the nations of the “Gentiles the formation of a °great church.
5 And the angel said unto me: Behold the formation of a “church which is most abominable above all other churches, which °slayeth the saints of God, yea, and tortureth them. and bindeth them down, and yoketh them with a ‘yoke of iron, and bringeth them down into cap- tivity.

19 And I, Nephi, beheld that the Gentiles that had gone out of cap- tivity were “delivered by the power of God out of the hands of all other nations.
20 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, Deheld that they did prosper in the land; and I beheld a “book, and it was carried forth among them.

25 Wherefore, these things go forth from the “Jews in purity unto the >Gentiles, according to the truth which is in God.
26 And after they go forth by the *hand of the twelve apostles of the Lamb, from the Jews °unto the Gentiles, thou seest the formation of that ‘great and abominable ¢church, which is most abominable above all other churches; for behold, they have ‘taken away from the gospel of the Lamb many parts which are ‘plain and most precious; and also many covenants of the Lord have they taken away.
27 And all this have they done that they might pervert the right ways of the Lord, that they might blind the eyes and harden the hearts of the children of men.
28 Wherefore, thou seest that after the book hath gone forth through the hands of the great and abomin- able church, that there are many plain and “precious things taken away from the book, which is the book of the Lamb of God.

30 Nevertheless, thou beholdest that the Gentiles who have gone forth out of captivity, and have been lifted up by the power of God above all other nations, upon the face of the land which is choice above all other lands, which is the land that the Lord God hath covenanted with thy father that his seed should have for the ‘land of their inheritance; wherefore, thou seest that the Lord God will not suffer that the Gentiles will utterly destroy the "mixture of thy ‘seed, which are among thy brethren.
31 Neither will he suffer that the Gentiles shall *destroy the seed of thy brethren.
32 Neither will the Lord God suffer that the Gentiles shall forever re- main in that awful state of blind- ness, which thou beholdest they are in, because of the plain. and most precious parts of the gospel of the Lamb which have been kept back by that “abominable church, whose formation thou hast seen.

AND it shall come to pass, that if the 2Gentiles shall hearken unto the Lamb of God in that day that he shall manifest himself unto them in word, and also in "power, in very deed, unto the ‘taking away of their 4stumbling blocks—

24 And behold; the things which this “apostle of the Lamb shall write are many things which thou hast seen; and behold, the remainder shalt thou see.
25 But the things which thou shalt see hereafter thou shalt not write; for the Lord God hath ordained the apostle of the Lamb of God that he should “write them.
26 And also others who have been, to them hath he shown all things, and they have ‘written them; and they are "sealed up to come forth in their purity, according to the truth which is in the Lamb, in the own due time of the Lord, unto the house of Israel.
27 And I, Nephi, heard and bear record, that the name of the apostle of the Lamb was “John, according to the word of the angel.
28 And behold, I, Nephi, am for- bidden that I should write the remainder of the things which I saw and heard; wherefore the things which I have written sufficeth me; and I have written but a small part of the things which I saw.
29 And I bear record that I saw the things which my “father saw, and the angel of the Lord did make them known unto me.
30 And now I make an end of speak- ing concerning the things which I saw while I was “carried away in the spirit; and if all the things which I saw are not written, the things which I have written are "true. And thus it is. Amen.

an olive tree whose natural branches shall be grafted in again—Nephi interprets the vision of the tree of life and speaks of the justice of God in dividing the wicked from the righteous.
AND it came to pass that after I, Nephi, had been carried away in the spirit, and seen all these things, I returned to the tent of my father.
2 And it came to pass that I beheld my brethren, and they were disput- ing one with another concerning the things which my father had spoken unto them.
3 For he truly spake many great things unto them, which were hard to be “understood, saveaman should inquire of the Lord; and they being hard in their hearts, therefore they did not look unto the Lord as they ought.
4 And now I, Nephi, was grieved because of the hardness of their hearts, and also, because of the things which I had seen, and knew they must unavoidably come to pass because of the great wickedness of the children of men.
5 And it came to pass that I was Overcome because of my afflictions, for I considered that mine “afflictions were great above all, because of the >destruction of my people, for I had beheld their fall.
6 And it came to pass that after I had received “strength I spake unto my brethren, desiring to know of them the cause of their disputations.
7 And they said: Behold, we cannot understand the words which our father hath spoken concerning the natural branches of the “olive-tree, and also concerning the Gentiles.
8 And I said unto them: Have ye “inquired of the Lord?

10 Behold, I-said unto them: How is it that ye do not keep the com- mandments of the Lord? How is it that ye will “perish, because of the hardness of your hearts?
11-Do ye not remember the things which the Lord hath said?—If ye will not harden your hearts, and “ask me in “faith, believing that ye shall receive, with diligence in keeping my commandments, surely these things shall be made known unto you.
12 Behold, I say unto you, that the house of Israel was compared unto an olive-tree, by the Spirit of the Lord which was in our father; and behold are we not broken off from the house of Israel, and are we not a “branch of the house of Israel?
13 And now, the thing which our father meaneth concerning — the grafting in of the natural branches through the fulness of the Gentiles, is, that in the latter days, when our seed shall have *dwindled in un- belief, yea, for the space of many years, and many generations after the "Messiah shall be manifested in body unto the children of men, then shall the fulness of the “gospel of the Messiah come unto the Gentiles, and from the ‘Gentiles unto the remnant of our seed—

15 And then at that day will they not rejoice and give praise unto their everlasting God, their “rock and their salvation? Yea, at that day, will they not receive the strength and nourishment from the true >vine? Yea, will they not come unto the true fold of God?
16 Behold, I say unto you, Yea; they shall be remembered again among the house of Israel; they shall be °grafted in, being a natural branch of the olive-tree, into the true olive-tree.
17 And this is what our father meaneth; and he meaneth that it will not come to pass until after they are scattered by the Gentiles; and he meaneth that it shall come by way of the Gentiles, that the Lord may show his power unto the Gentiles, for the very cause that he shall be “rejected of the Jews, or of the house of Israel.
18 Wherefore, our father hath not spoken of our seed alone, but also of all the house of Israel, pointing to the covenant which should be ful- filled in the latter days; which covenant the Lord made to our father Abraham, saying: In thy "seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be ’blessed.

19 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, spake much. unto them con- cerning these things; yea, I spake unto them concerning the “restora- tion of the Jews in the latter days.
20 And I-did rehearse unto them the words of “Isaiah, who spake | *concerning the ‘restoration of the Jews, or of the house of Israel; and after they were restored they should no more be confounded, neither should they be scattered again. And it came to pass that I did speak many words unto my brethren, that they were pacified and did “humble them- selves before the Lord.
21 And it came to pass that they did speak unto me again, saying: What meaneth this thing which our father saw in a dream? What mean- eth the “tree which he saw?
22 And I said unto them: It was a representation of the “tree of life.
23 And they said unto me: What meaneth the “rod of iron which our father saw, that led to the tree?
24 And I said unto them that it was the “word of God; and whoso would hearken unto the word of God, and would "hold fast unto it, they would Never perish; neither could the ‘temptations and the fiery “darts of the ‘adversary overpower them unto blindness, to lead them away to destruction.
25 Wherefore, I, Nephi, did exhort them to give “heed unto the word of the Lord; yea, I did exhort them with all the energies of my soul, and with all the °faculty which I pos- sessed, that they would give heed to the word of God and remember

to keep his commandments always in all things. :
26 And they said unto me: What meaneth the “river of water which our father saw?
27 And I said unto them that the “water which my father saw was >filthiness; and so much was his mind swallowed up in other things that he beheld not the filthiness of the water.
28 And I said unto them that it was an awful “gulf, which separated the wicked from the tree of life, and also from the saints of God.
29 And I said unto them that it was a representation of that awful “hell, which the angel said unto me was prepared for the wicked.
30 And I said unto them that our father also saw that the “justice of God did also divide the wicked from the righteous; and the brightness thereof was like unto the brightness of a flaming “fire, which ascendeth up unto God forever and ever, and hath no end.
31 And they said unto me: Doth this thing mean the torment of the body in the days of “probation, or doth it mean the final state of the soul after the ’death of the temporal body, or doth it speak of the things which are temporal?
32 And it came to pass that I said unto them that it was a representa- tion of things both temporal’ and spiritual; for the day should come that they must be judged of their “works, yea, even the works which were done by the temporal body in their days of "probation.

33-Wherefore, if they should “die in their wickedness they must be °cast off also, as to the-things which are spiritual, which are pertaining to. righteousness; wherefore, they must be brought to stand before God, to be “judged of their-¢works; and if their works have been filthi- ness they must needs be “filthy; and if they be filthy it must needs be that they cannot ‘dwell in the king- dom of God; if so, the kingdom of God must be filthy also.
34 But behold, I say unto you, the kingdom of God is not filthy, and there cannot any unclean. thing enter into the kingdom of God; wherefore there must needs be a place of “filthiness prepared for that which is filthy.
35 And there is a place prepared, yea, even that “awful "hell of which I have spoken, and the “devil is the preparator of it; wherefore the final state of the souls of men is to dwell in the kingdom of God, or to be cast cut because of that “justice of which I have spoken.
36 Wherefore, the wicked are rejected from the righteous, and also from that “tree of life, whose
fruit ‘is most precious and most |

AND now it came to pass that after I, Nephi, had made an end of speak- ing to my brethren, behold they said unto me: Thou hast declared unto us hard things, more than we are able to bear.
2 And it came to pass that I said unto them that I knew that I had spoken “hard things against the wicked, according to the truth; and the righteous have I justified, and testified that they should be lifted up at the last day; wherefore, the bsuilty taketh the “truth to be hard, for it ¢cutteth them to the very center.
3 And now my brethren, if ye were righteous and were willing to hearken to the truth, and give heed unto it, that ye might ¢walk up- rightly before God, then ye would not murmur because of the truth, and say: Thou speakest hard things against us.
4 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did exhort my brethren, with all diligence, to keep the command- ments of the Lord.

and done as my father dwelt in a tent in the “valley which he called Lemuel.
7 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, took one of the “daughters of Ishmael to wife; and also, my brethren took of the ‘daughters of Ishmael to wife; and also ¢Zoram took the eldest daughter of Ishmael to wife.
8 And thus my father had fulfilled all the °?commandments of the Lord which had been given unto him. And also, I, Nephi, had been blessed of the Lord exceedingly.
9 And it came to pass that the voice of the Lord spake unto my father by night, and commanded him that on the morrow he should take his “journey into the wilderness.
10 And it came to pass that as my |
father arose in the morning, and went forth to the tent door, to his great astonishment he beheld upon the ground a round “ball of curious workmanship; and it was of fine brass. And within the ball were two spindles; and the one °pointed the way whither we should go into the wilderness.
11 And it came to pass that we did gather together whatsoever things we should carry into the wilderness, and all the remainder of our pro- visions which the-Lord had given unto us; and we did take “seed of every kind that we might carry into the wilderness.
12 And it came to pass that we did take our tents and depart into the wilderness, across the river Laman.
13 And it came to pass that we traveled for the space of four days, nearly a south-southeast direction, and we did pitch our tents again; and we did cal) the name of the place “Shazer.

14 And it came to pass that we did | take our bows and our arrows, and |
go forth into the wilderness to slay food for our families; and after we
had'slain food for our families we did |
return again to our families in the
wilderness, to the place of Shazer. |
And we did go forth again in the
wilderness, following the same direc- |
tion, keeping in the most fertile
parts of the wilderness, which were |
in the borders near the “Red Sea. 15 And it came to pass that we did travel for the space of many days, %slaying food by the way, with our bows and our arrows and our stones and our slings. 16 And we did follow the “direc-
tions of the ball, which led us in the | more fertile parts of the wilderness. |
17 And after we had traveled for the space of many days, we did pitch our tents for the space of a time, that we might again rest our- selves and obtain food for our families.
18 And it came to pass that as I, Nephi, went forth to slay food, behold, I did break my bow, which was made of fine “steel; and after I did break my bow, behold, my brethren were angry with me
because of the loss of my bow, for we |
did obtain no food. 19-And it came to pass that we did return without food to our families,
and being much fatigued, because |
of their journeying, they did suffer much for the want of food.
20 And it came to pass that Laman and Lemuel and the sons of Ishmael did begin to murmur exceedingly, because of their sufferings and
afflictions in the wilderness; and |
also my father began to murmur against the Lord his God; yea, and they were all exceedingly sorrowful,

even that they did“murmur against the Lord.
21 Now it came to“pass that I, Nephi, having been afflicted with my brethren because of the loss of my bow, and their bows having lost their “springs, it began to be exceed- ingly difficult, yea, insomuch that we could obtain no food.
22 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did speak much unto my brethren, because they had hard- ened their hearts again, even unto “complaining against the Lord their God.
23 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did “make out of wood a bow, and out of a straight stick, an arrow; wherefore, I did arm myself with a bow and an arrow, with a sling and with stones. And I said unto my *father: Whither shall I go to obtain food?
24 And it came to pass that he did “inquire of the Lord, for they had *humbled themselves because of my words; for I did say many things unto them in the energy of my soul.
25 And it came to pass that the voice of the Lord came unto my father; and he was truly “chastened because of his murmuring against the Lord, insomuch that he was brought down into the depths of sorrow.
26 And it came to pass that the voice of the Lord said unto him: Look upon the ball, and behold the things which are written.
27 And it came to pass that when my father beheld the things which were “written upon the ball, he did fear and tremble exceedingly, and also my brethren and the sons of Ishmael and our wives.

28 And it came to pass ‘that I, Nephi, beheld the pointers which were in the ball, that they did work according to the “faith and diligence and heed which we did give unto them.
29 And there was also written upon them a new writing, which was plain to be read, which did give us “under- standing concerning the ways of the Lord; and it was written and changed from time to time, accord- ing to the faith and diligence which we gave unto it. And thus we see that by ’small means the Lord can bring about great things.
30 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did go forth up into the top of the mountain, according to the “directions which were given upon the ball.
31 And it came to pass that I did slay wild “beasts, insomuch that I did obtain food for our families.
32 And it came to pass that I did return to our tents, bearing the beasts which I had slain; and now when they beheld that I had ob- tained “food, how great was their joy! And it came to pass that they did humble themselves before the Lord, and did give thanks unto him.
33 And it came to pass that we did again take our journey, traveling nearly the same course as in the beginning; and after we had traveled for the space of many days we did pitch our tents again, that we might tarry for the space of a time.
34 And it came to pass that “Ish- mael died, and was buried in the place which was called "Nahom.

their father, and because of their afflictions in the wilderness; and they did ‘murmur against my father, because he had brought them out of the land of Jerusalem, saying: Our father is dead; yea, and we have wandered much in the wilderness, and we have suffered much afflic- tion, hunger, thirst, and fatigue; and after all these sufferings we must perish in the wilderness with hunger.
36 And thus they did murmur against my father, and also against me; -and they were desirous to “re- turn again to Jerusalem.
37 And Laman said unto Lemuel and also unto the sons of Ishmael: Behold, let us ?slay our father, and also our brother Nephi, who has taken it upon him to be our "ruler and our teacher, who are his elder brethren.
38 Now, he says that the Lord has talked with him, and also that angels have ministered unto him. But behold, we know that he lies unto us; and he tells us these things, and he worketh many things by his cunning arts, that he may deceive our eyes, thinking, perhaps, that he may lead us away into some strange wilderness; and after he has led us away, he has thought to make him- self a king and a ruler over us, that he may do with us according to his will and pleasure. And after this manner did my brother Laman °’stir up their hearts to ‘anger.
39 And it came to pass that the Lord was with us, yea, even the voice of the Lord came and did speak many words unto them, and did “chasten them exceedingly; and after they were chastened by the voice of the Lord they did turn away their anger, and did repent of
36 |
their sins, insomuch that the Lord
did bless us again with food, that |
we did not perish.

Nephi is commanded to build a ship— His brethren oppose him—He exhorts | them by recounting the history of God’s |

AND it came to pass that we did again take our journey in the wilder- ness; and we did travel nearly east- ward from that time forth. And we did travel and “wade through much affliction in the wilderness; and our *’women did bear children in the wilderness.
2 And so great were the “blessings of the Lord upon us, that while we did live upon raw ‘meat in the wilderness, our women did give plenty of suck for their children, and were strong, yea, even like unto
the men; and they began to bear |
their journeyings without murmur- |
ings.
3 And thus we see that the com- mandments of God must be fulfilled: And if it so be that the children of men keep the commandments of God he doth nourish them, and “strengthen them, and provide
means whereby they can accomplish the thing which he has commanded |
them; wherefore, he did "provide means for us while we did sojourn in the wilderness.

of its much fruit and also wild honey; and all these things were prepared of the Lord that we might not perish. And we beheld the sea, which we called Irreantum, which, being interpreted, is many waters.
6 And it came to pass that we did pitch our tents by the seashore; and notwithstanding we had. suf- fered many “afflictions and much difficulty, yea, even so. much that we cannot write them all, we were exceedingly rejoiced when. we came to the seashore; and we called the place Bountiful, because of its much fruit.
7 And it came to pass that after I, Nephi, had been in the land. of Bountiful for the space of many days, the voice of the Lord came unto me, saying: “Arise, and get thee into the mountain. And it came to pass that I arose and went up into the mountain, and cried unto the Lord.
8 And it came to pass that the Lord spake unto me, saying: Thou shalt 2construct a ship, after the "manner which I shall show thee, that I may carry thy people across these waters.
9 And I said: Lord, whither shall I go that I may find ore to molten, that I may make “tools to construct the ship after the manner which thou hast shown unto me?
10 And it came to pass thatthe Lord told me whither I should go to find ore, that I might make tools.
11 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did make a bellows where- with to “blow the fire, of the skins of beasts;.and after 1 had made a bellows, that I might have where- with to blow the fire, I did smite two

12 For the Lord had not hitherto suffered that we should make much fire, as we journeyed in the wilder- ness; for he said: I will make thy food become sweet, that ye “cook it not; : ~ 13 And I will also:be your “light in the wilderness; and I will prepare the way before you, if it so be that ye shal] keep my commandments; wherefore, inasmuchas ye shall keep my commandments ye shall be led towards the ’promised land; and ye shall “know that it is by me that ye are led.
14 Yea, and the Lord said also that: Afteryehavearrivedin the promised land, ye shall “know that I, the Lord, am °God; and that I, the Lord, did ‘deliver you from destruction; yea, that I did bring you out of the land of Jerusalem.
15 Wherefore, I, Nephi, did strive to keep the “commandments of the Lord, and I did °exhort my brethren to faithfulness and dili- gence.
16 And it came to pass that I did “make tools of the ore which I did molten out of the rock.
17 And. when my brethren saw that I was about to “build a ship, they began to ’murmur against me, say- ing: Our brother is a fool, for he thinketh that he can build a ship; yea, and he also thinketh that he can cross these great waters.
18 And thus my brethren did *complain against me, and were desirous that they might not labor, for they did not "believe that I could build a ship; neither would they

19 And now it came to-pass that I, Nephi, was exceedingly sorrow- ful because of the hardness of their hearts; and now when they saw that I began to be sorrowful they were glad in their hearts, insomuch that they did “rejoice over me, saying: We knew that yecould not construct a ship, for we knew that ye were lacking in’ judgment; wherefore, thou canst not accomplish sogreata work.

21 Behold, these many years we have suffered in the wilderness, which time we might have enjoyed our possessions and the land of our inheritance; yea, and we might have been happy.

31 And it came to pass that accord- ing to his word he did “destroy them ; and according to his word he did ‘lead them; and according to his word he did do all things for them; and there was not any thing done save it were by his word.

4neople had rejected every word of God, and they were ripe in iniquity; and the fulness of the wrath of God was upon them; and the Lord did curse the land against them, and bless it unto our fathers; yea, he did curse it against them unto their destruction, and he did bless it unto our fathers:-unto their obtaining power over it.

fiery flying °serpents among them; and after they were bitten he pre- pared a way that they might be ‘healed; and the labor which they had to perform was to look; and because of the “simpleness of the way, or the easiness of it, there were many who perished.
42 And they did harden their hearts from time to time, and they did *revile against °Moses, and~ also against God; nevertheless, ye know that they were led forth by his matchless power into the land of promise.
43 And now, after all these things, the time has come that they have be- come wicked, yea, nearly unto ripe- ness; and I know not but they are at this day about to be “destroyed; for I know that the day must surely come that they must be destroyed, save a few only, who shall be led away into captivity.
44 Wherefore, the Lord “com- manded my father that he should depart into the wilderness; and the Jews also sought to take away his life; yea, and °ye also have sought to take away his life; wherefore, ye are murderers in your hearts and ye are like unto them.
45 Ye are “swift to do iniquity but slow to remember the Lord your God. Ye have seen an "angel, and he spake unto you; yea, ye have heard his voice from time to time; and he hath spoken unto you in a still small voice, but ye were ‘past feeling, that ye could not feel his words; where- fore, he has spoken unto you like unto the voice of thunder, which did cause the earth to shake as if it were to divide asunder,
46 And ye also know that by the
40
“power of his almighty word he can cause the earth that it shall pass away; yea, and ye know that by his word he can cause the rough places to be made smooth, and smooth places shall be broken up. O, then, why is it, that ye can be so hard in your hearts?
47 Behold, my soul is rent with anguish because of you, and my heart is pained; I fear Jest ye shall be cast off forever. Behold, I am “full of the Spirit of God, insomuch that my frame has °no strength.
48 And now it came to pass that when I had spoken these words they were angry with me, and were de- sirous to throw me into the depths of the sea; and as they came forth to lay their hands upon me I spake unto them, saying: In the name of the Almighty God, I command you that ye “touch me not, for I am filled with the “power of God, even unto the consuming of my flesh; and whoso shall lay his hands upon me shall ‘wither even as a dried reed; and he shall be as naught before the power | of God, for God shall smite him.
49 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said unto them that they should murmur no more against their father; neither should they withhold their labor from me, for God had commanded me that I should “build a ship.
50 And I said unto them: “If God | had commanded me to do all things I could do them. If he should com- mand me that I should say unto this water, be thou earth, it should be earth; andif I should say it, it would be done.

52 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said many things unto my brethren, insomuch that they were *confounded and could not contend against me; neither durst they lay their hands upon me nor touch me with their fingers, even for the space of many days. Now they durst not do this lest they should wither before me, so powerful was the Spirit of God; and thus it had wrought upon them.
53 And it came to pass that the Lord said unto me: Stretch forth thine hand again unto thy brethren, and they shall not wither before thee, but I will “shock them, saith the Lord, and this will I do, that they may know that I am the Lord their God.
54 And it came to pass that I stretched forth my hand unto my brethren, and they did not wither before me; but the Lord did shake them, even according to the word which he had spoken.
55 And now, they said: We know of a surety that the Lord is “with thee, for we know that itis the power of the Lord that has shaken us. And they fell down before me, and were about to ’worship me, but I would not suffer them, saying: I am thy brother, yea, even thy younger brother; wherefore, worship the Lord thy God, and honor thy father and thy mother, that thy ‘days:may be long in the land which the Lord thy God shall give thee.

AND it came to pass that they did *worship the Lord, and did go forth with me; and we did work timbers of curious "workmanship. And the Lord did show me from time to time after what manner I should work the timbers of the ‘ship.

7 And now, my father had begat two sons in the wilderness; the elder was called “Jacob and the younger > Joseph.
8 And it came to pass after we had all gone down into the ship, and had taken with us our provisions and things which had been commanded us, we did put forth into the “sea and were driven forth before the wind towards the “promised land.
9 And after we had been ?driven forth before the wind for the space of many days, behold, my brethren and the sons of Ishmael and also their wives began to make them- selves merry, insomuch that they began to dance, and to sing, and to speak with much °rudeness, yea, even that they did forget by what power they had been _ brought thither; yea, they were lifted up un- to exceeding rudeness.

Wherefore, they knew not whither they should steer the ship, insomuch that there arose a great “storm, yea, a great and terrible tempest, and we were °driven back upon the waters for the space of three days; and they began to be frightened exceedingly lest they should be drowned in the sea; never- theless they did not loose me.

land; and we went forth upon the land, and did pitch our tents; and we did call it the promised land.
24 And it came to pass that we did begin to till the earth, and we began to plant seeds; yea, we did put all our “seeds into the earth, which we had brought from the land of Jeru- salem. And it came to pass that they did grow exceedingly; where- fore, we were blessed in abun- dance.
25 And it came to pass that we did find upon the land of promise, as we journeyed in. the wilderness, that there were “beasts in the forests of every kind, both the cow and the ox, and the ass and the horse, and the goat.and the wild goat, and all manner of wild animals, which were for the use of men. And we did find all manner of “ore, both of. ‘gold, and of silver, and of copper.
CHAPTER 19
Nephi makes plates of ore and records the history of his people—The God of Israel will come six hundred years from the time Lehi left Jerusalem— Nephi tells of His sufferings and crucifixion—The Jews shall be de- spised and scattered until the latter days, when they shall return unto the Lord.
AND it came to pass that the Lord commanded me, wherefore 1 did make plates of ore that I might en- graven upon them the “record of my. people. And. upon the plates which I made I did "engraven the record of my ‘father, and also our journeyings in the wilderness, and the prophecies of my father; and also many of mine own prophecies have I engraven upon them.

manded of the Lord to make “these plates; wherefore, the record of my father, and the genealogy of his fathers, and the more part of all our proceedings in the wilderness are engraven upon those first plates of which I have spoken; wherefore, the things which transpired before I made "these plates are, of a truth, more particularly made mention up- on the first plates.
3 And after I had made these plates by way of commandment, I, Nephi, received a commandment that the ministry and the prophecies, the more plain and precious parts of them, should be written upon “these plates; and that the things which were written should be kept for the instruction of my people, who should possess the land, and also for other ’wise purposes, which purposes are known unto the Lord.
4 Wherefore, I, Nephi, did make a record upon the “other plates, which gives an account, or which gives a greater account of the wars and contentions and destructions of my people. And this have I done, and commanded my people what they should do after I was gone; and that these plates should be handed down from one generation to another, or from one prophet to another, until further commandments of the Lord.
5 And an account of my “making these plates shall be given hereafter ; and then, behold, I proceed accord-

things may be °kept for the know- ledge of my people.
6 Nevertheless, I do not “write anything upon plates save it be that I think it be "sacred. And now, if I do err, even did they err of old; not that I would excuse myself because of other men, but because of the ‘weakness which is in me, according to the flesh, I would excuse myself.

to the body and soul, others set at || *naught and trample under their |

do men "trample under their feet; 1 |

towards the children of men.

°God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, “yieldeth himself, according to the words-of the angel, as a man, into the hands of ‘wicked men, to be ‘lifted up, according to the words of ’Zenock, and to be crucified, according to the words of Neum, and to be buried in a ‘sepulchre, according to the words of /Zenos, which he spake concerning the three days of “darkness, which should be a sign given of his death unto those who should inhabit the isles of the sea, more especially given unto those who are of the "house of Israel.
11 For thus spake the prophet: The Lord God surely shall visit all the house of Israel at that day, some with his voice, because of their righteousness, unto their great joy and salvation, and others. with the ‘thunderings and the lightnings of his power, by tempest, by fire, and by “smoke, and ’vapor of ‘darkness, and by the opening of the ’earth, and by “mountains which shall be carried up.
12:And all these things must-surely come, saith the prophet ’Zenos. And the ‘rocks of the earth must rend; and because of the “groanings of the earth, many of the kings of the isles
1 NEPHI 19:11-17
of the sea shall be wrought upon by the Spirit of God, to exclaim: The God of nature suffers.
13 And as for those who are at Jerusalem, saith the prophet, they shall be “scourged by all people, because they crucify the God of
Israel, and turn their hearts aside,
rejecting signs and wonders, and the power and glory of the God of Israel.
14 And because they turn their hearts aside, saith the prophet, and have “despised the Holy One of Israel, they shall wander in the flesh, and perish, and become a °hiss anda ‘byword, and be “hated among all nations.
15 Nevertheless, when that day cometh, saith the prophet, that they “no more "turn aside their hearts against the Holy One of Israel, then will he remember the ‘covenants which he made to their fathers.
16 Yea, then will he remember the “isles of the sea; yea, and all the people who are of the house of Israel, will I °gather in, saith the Lord, according to the words. of the prophet Zenos, from the four quarters of the earth.
17 Yea, and all the earth shall “see the salvation of the Lord, saith the

18 And I, Nephi, have written these things unto my people, that perhaps I might persuade them that they would “remember the Lord their Redeemer.
19 Wherefore, I speak unto all the house of Israel, if it so be that they should obtain “these things.
20 For behold, I have workings in the spirit, which doth “weary me even that all my joints are weak, for those who are at Jerusalem; for had not the Lord been merciful, to show unto me concerning them, even as he had prophets of old, I should have perished also.
21 And he surely did show unto the “prophets of old all things °con- cerning them; and also he did show unto many concerning us; where- fore, it must needs be that we know concerning them for they are writ- ten upon the plates of brass.
22 Now it came to pass that I, Nephi, did teach my brethren these things; and it came to pass that I did read many things to them, which were engraven upon the “plates of brass, that they might know con- cerning the doings of the Lord in other lands, among people of old.
23 And I did read many things unto them which were written in the “books of Moses; but that I might more fully persuade them to believe in the Lord their Redeemer I did read unto them that which was written by the prophet Isaiah; for I did ‘liken all scriptures unto us, that it might be for our “profit and learning.

23 And “kings shall be thy °nursing fathers, and their queens thy nurs- ing mothers; they shall bow down to thee with their face towards the earth, and lick up the dust of thy feet; and thou shalt know that I am the Lord; for they shall not be ashamed that ‘wait for me.
24 For shall the prey be taken from the mighty, or the “lawful captives delivered?
25 But thus saith the Lord, even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away, and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered; for I will contend with him that contendeth with thee, and I will save thy children.

Israel shall be scattered upon all the face of the earth—The gentiles shall nurse and nourish Israel with the gospel in the last days—Israel shall be gathered and saved, and the wicked shall burn as stubble—The kingdom of the devil shall be destroyed, and Satan shall be bound.
AND now it came to pass that after I, Nephi, had read these things which were engraven upon the plates of brass, my brethren came unto me and said unto me: What ’meaneth these things which ye have read? Behold, are they to be under- stood according to things-which are ‘spiritual, which shall come to pass according to the spirit and not the flesh? ;
2 And I, Nephi, said unto them: Behold they were “manifest unto the prophet by the voice of the ‘Spirit; for by the Spirit are all things made known unto the ‘prophets, which shall come upon the children of men according to the flesh.
3 Wherefore, the things of which I have read are things pertaining to things both “temporal and spiritual; for it appears that the house of Israel, sooner or later, will be °scat- tered upon all the face of the earth, and also ‘among all nations.

Lord God will proceed to do a “marvelous work among the ’Gen- tiles, which shall be of great ‘worth unto our seed; wherefore, it is likened unto their being nourished by the “Gentiles and being carried in their arms and upon their shoulders. =
9 And it shall also be of “worth unto the Gentiles; and not only unto the Gentiles but °unto all the “house of Israel, unto the making known of the “covenants of the Father of heaven unto Abraham, saying: In thy ’seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be tblessed.
10.And I would, my brethren, that ye should know that.all the kindreds of the earth cannot be blessed unless he shall make “bare his arm in the eyes of the nations.

ed with me should be a land for the inheritance of my seed. Yea, the Lord hath ¢covenanted this land unto me, and to my children forever, and also all those who should be ‘led out of other countries by the hand of the Lord:
6 Wherefore, I, Lehi, prophesy according to the workings of the Spirit which is in me, that there shall “none come into this land save they shall be brought by the hand of the Lord.
7 Wherefore, this “land is con- secrated unto him whom he shall bring. And if it so be that they shall serve him according to the com- mandments which he hath given, it shall bea land of "liberty unto them; wherefore, they shall never be brought down into captivity; if so, it shall be because of iniquity ; for if iniquity shall abound ‘cursed shall be the land for their sakes, but unto the righteous it shall be blessed forever.
8 And behold, it is wisdom that this land should be *kept as yet from the knowledge of other ’nations; for behold, many nations would over- run the land, that there would be no place for an inheritance.
9 Wherefore, I, Lehi, have obtained a “promise, that "inasmuch as those whom the Lord God shall bring out of the land of Jerusalem shall keep his commandments, they shall ‘prosper upon the face of this land; and they shall be kept from all other nations, that they may possess this land unto themselves. And if it so be that they shall “keep his com- mandments they shall-be blessed upon the face of this land, and there shall be none to molest them, nor to

Redemption cometh through the Holy Messiah—Freedom of choice (agency) is essential to existence and progression —Adam fell that men might be— | Men are free to choose liberty and eternal life.
AND now, Jacob, I speak unto you: Thou art my “first-born in the days |} of my tribulation in the wilderness. And behold, in thy childhood thou hast suffered afflictions and much
sorrow, because of the rudeness of |}
thy brethren.
2 Nevertheless, Jacob, my first- born in the wilderness, thou knowest | the greatness of God; and he shall consecrate thine “afflictions for thy | gain. | 3 Wherefore, thy soul shall be | blessed, and thou shalt dwell safely | with thy brother, Nephi; and thy |} days shall be “spent in the service of } thy God.

of time he cometh to bring salvation unto men.
4 And thou hast “beheld in thy youth his glory ; wherefore, thou art blessed even as they unto whom he shall minister in the flesh; for the Spirit is the same, yesterday, today, and forever. And the way is pre- pared from the fall of man, and ’salvation is ‘free.
5 And men are instructed suffi- ciently that they “know good from evil. And the "law is given unto men. And by the law no flesh is ‘justified; or, by the law men are ¢cut off. Yea, by the temporal law they were cut off; and also, by the spiritual law they perish from that which = is good, and become miserable for- ever.
6 Wherefore, “redemption cometh in and through the ?Holy ‘Messiah; for he is full of “grace and truth.
7 Behold, he offereth himself a “sacrifice for sin, to answer the ends of the law, unto all those who havea broken heart and a contrite spirit; and unto ’none else can the ‘ends of the law be answered.
8 Wherefore, how great the importance to make these things known unto the inhabitants of the earth, that they may know that there is no flesh that can dwell in the

12 Wherefore, it must needs have been created for a thing of naught; wherefore there would have been no’purpose in theend of its creation. Wherefore, this thing must needs destroy the wisdom of God and his eternal purposes, and also the power, and the mercy, and the "justice of God.

children; yea, even the “family of all the earth.
21 And the days of the children of “men were prolonged, according to the will of God, that they might ‘repent while in the flesh ; wherefore, their state became a state of “pro- bation, and their time was length- ened, according to the command- ments which the Lord God gave unto the children of men. For he gave commandment that all men must repent; for he showed unto all men that they were “lost, because of the transgression of their parents.
22 And now, behold, if Adam had not transgressed he would not have fallen, but he would have remained in the garden of Eden. And all things which were created must have re- mained in the same state in which they were after they were created; and they must have remained for- ever, and had no end.
23 And they would have had no “children; wherefore they would have remained in a state of in- nocence, having no °joy, for they knew no misery ; doing no good, for they knew no ‘sin.

the children of men from the fall. And because that they are ‘re- deemed from the fall they have be- come “free forever, knowing good from evil; to act for themselves and not to be acted upon, save it be by the punishment of the “law at the great and last day, according to the commandments which God hath given.
27 Wherefore, men are “free accord- ing to the "flesh; and ‘all things are 4given them which are expedient unto man. And they are free to “choose ‘liberty and eternal ‘life, through the great Mediator of all men, or to choose captivity and death, according to the captivity and power of the devil; for he seek- eth that allmen might be” miserable like unto himself.

Joseph in Egypt saw the Nephites in vision—He prophesied of Joseph Smith, the latter-day seer; of Moses, who would deliver Israel; and of the coming forth of the Book of Mormon.
AND now I speak unto you, Joseph, my “last-born. Thou wast born in the wilderness of mine afflictions; yea, in the days of my greatest sorrow did thy mother bear thee.
2 And may the Lord. consecrate also unto thee this “land, which is a most precious land, for thine in- heritance and the inheritance of thy seed with thy brethren, for thy security forever, if it so be that ye shall keep the commandments of the Holy One of Israel.
3 And now, Joseph, my last-born, whom I have brought out of the wilderness of mine afflictions, may the Lord bless thee forever, for thy “seed shall not utterly be ’destroyed.
4 For behold, thou art the fruit of my loins; and I am a descendant of “Joseph who was carried °cap- tive into Egypt. And great were the ‘covenants of the Lord which he made unto Joseph.
5 Wherefore, Joseph truly “saw our day. And he obtained a "promise of the Lord, that out of the fruit of his loins the Lord God would raise up a ‘righteous “branch unto the

6 For Joseph truly testified, saying: | i A ‘seer shall the Lord my God raise | up, who shall be a choice seer unto |)

7 Yea, Joseph truly said: Thus i
saith the Lord unto me: A choice 9seer will I “raise up out of the fruit
of thy loins; and he shall beesteemed | highly among the fruit of thy loins. ||
And unto him will I give command-
ment that he shall do a work for |} the fruit of thy loins, his brethren, |
which shall be of great worth unto
them, even to the bringing of them ||
to the ‘knowledge of the covenants which I have made with thy fathers.
8 And I will give unto him a com- mandment that he shall do “none other work, save the work which I
shall command him. And I will make |
him great in mine eyes; for he shall do my work.
9 And he shall be great like unto }

will I give "power to ‘bring forth my word unto the seed of thy loins— and not to the bringing forth my word only, saith the Lord, but to the convincing them of my. word, which shall have already gone forth among them. :
12 Wherefore, the fruit of thy loins shall “write; and the fruit of the loins of °Judah shall ‘write; and that which shall be written by the fruit of thy loins, andalso that which shall. be written by the fruit of the loins of Judah, shall grow together, unto the ‘confounding of °false doctrines and laying. down. of con- tentions, and establishing ‘peace among the fruit of thy loins, and ’bringing them to the "knowledge of their fathers in the latter days, and also to the knowledge of my covenants, saith the Lord.
13 And out of weakness he shall be made strong, in that day when my work shal) commence.among all my people, unto the restoring thee, O house of Israel, saith the Lord.
14 And thus prophesied Joseph, saying: Behold, that seer will the Lord bless;.and they that seek to destroy him shalJl._ be confounded; for this promise, which I. have ob- tained of the Lord, of the fruit of my loins, shall be fulfilled. Behold, Iam sure of the fulfilling of this promise;

it.
19 And the words which he shall write shall be the words which are expedient in my wisdom should go forth unto the “fruit of thy loins. And it shall be as if the fruit of thy loins had cried unto them °from the dust; for I know their faith.

future generations; and they are |
written upon the "plates of brass. 3 Wherefore, after my father had
made an end of speaking concerning |} the prophecies of Joseph, he called ||
the children of Laman, his sons, and his daughters, and said unto them: Behold, my sons, and my daughters, who are the sons and the daughters
of my “first-born, I would that ye |}
should give ear unto my words.

Behold, my sons and my daughters, who are the sons and the daughters of my second son; béhold I Jeave unto.you the same blessing which I left unto the sons and daughters of Laman; wherefore, thou shalt not utterly be destroyed; but in the end thy seed shall be blessed.
10 And it came to pass that when my father had made an end of speaking unto them, behold, he spake unto the sons of “Ishmael, yea, and even all his household.
11 And after he had made an end of speaking unto them, he spake unto Sam, saying: Blessed art thou, and thy “seed; for thou shalt in- herit the Jand like unto thy brother Nephi. And thy seed shall be numbered with his seed; and thou shalt be even like unto thy brother, and thy seed like unto his seed; and thou shalt be blessed in all thy days.
12 And it came to pass after my father, Lehi, had “spoken unto all his household, according to the feel- ings of his heart and the Spirit of the Lord which was in him, he waxed bold. And it came to pass that he died, and was buried.
13. And it came to pass that not many days after his death, Laman and Lemuel and the sons of Ishmael were “angry with me because of the admonitions of the Lord.
14 For I, Nephi, was constrained to speak unto them, according to his word; for I had spoken many things unto them, and also my _ father, before his death; many of which sayings are written upon mine “other

15 And upon “these I write the things of my soul, and many of the scriptures which are engraven upon the plates of brass. For my soul ‘delighteth in the scriptures, and my heart “pondereth them, and writeth them for the “learning and the profit of my children.
16 Behold, my “soul delighteth in the things of the Lord; and my *heart. pondereth continually upon the things which I have seen and heard.

CHAPTER 5
The Nephites separate themselves from the Lamanites, keep the law of Moses, and build a temple—Because of their unbelief, the Lamanites are cursed, receive a skin of blackness, and become a scourge unto the Nephites.
BEHOLD, it came to pass that I, Nephi, did cry much unto the Lord my God, because of the “anger of my brethren.
2 But behold, their “anger did in- crease against me, insomuch that they did seek to take away my life.
3 Yea, they did murmur against me, saying: Our younger brother thinks to “rule over us; and we have had much trial because of him; wherefore, now let us slay him, that wemay not be afflicted more because of his words. For behold, we will not have him to be our ruler; for it belongs unto us, who are the elder brethren, to "rule over this people.
4 Now I do not write upon these plates all the words which they murmured against me. But it suffic- eth me to say, that they did seek to take away my life.
5 And it came to pass that the Lord did “warn me, that I, "Nephi, should depart from them and flee into the wilderness, and all those who would go with me.
6 Wherefore, it came to pass that I, Nephi, did take my family, and also *Zoram and his family, and Sam, mine elder brother and his family, and Jacob and Joseph, my younger

brethren, and also my sisters, and all those who would go with me. And all those who would go with me were those who believed in the >warnings and the revelations of God; wherefore, they did hearken unto my words.
7 And we did take our tents and whatsoever things were possible for us, and did journey in the wilderness for the space of many days. And after we had journeyed for the space of many days we did pitch our tents.
8 And my people would that we should call the name of the place *Nephi; wherefore, we did call it Nephi.
9 And all those who were with me did take upon them to call them- selves the “people of Nephi.
10 And we did observe to keep the judgments, and the “statutes, and the commandments of the Lord in all things, according to the "law of Moses.
11 And the Lord was with us; and we did “prosper exceedingly; for we did sow seed, and we did reap again in abundance. And we began to raise flocks, and herds, and animals of every kind.
12 And I, Nephi, had also brought the records which were engraven upon the “plates of brass; and also the "ball, or “compass, which was prepared for my father by the hand of the Lord, according to that which is written.
13 And it came to pass that we began to prosper exceedingly, and to multiply in the land.

ner of it did make many swords, lest by. any means the people who were now called Lamanites should come upon us and destroy us; for I knew their ‘hatred towards me and my children and those who were called my people.
15 And I did teach my people to “build buildings, and to work in all ‘manner of wood, and of “iron, and of copper, and of ’brass, and of steel, and of ‘gold, and of silver, and of precious ores, which were in great abundance.
16 And I, Nephi, did “build a ‘temple; and I did construct it after the manner of the temple of ‘Solomon save it were not built of so many “precious things; for they were not to be found upon the land, wherefore, it could not be built like unto Solomon’s ‘temple. But the manner of the construction was like unto the temple of ‘Solomon; and the workmanship thereof was ex- ceedingly fine.
17 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did cause my people to be “industrious, and to "labor with their ‘hands.
18 And it came to pass that they would that I should be their “king. But I, Nephi, was desirous that they should have no king; nevertheless, I did for them according to that which was in my power.
19 And behold, the words of the Lord had been fulfilled unto my

brethren, which he spake concerning them, that I should be their “ruler and their teacher. Wherefore, [had been their ruler and their °teacher, according to the commandments of the Lord, until the time they sought to take away my life.
20 Wherefore, the word of the Lord was fulfilled which he spake unto me, saying that: Inasmuch as they will “not hearken unto thy words they shall be °’cut off from the presence of the Lord. And behold, they were ‘cut off from his presence.
21 And he had caused the “cursing to come upon them, yea, even a sore cursing, because of their iniquity. For behold, they had hardened their hearts against him, that they had become like unto a flint ; wherefore, as they were white, and exceedingly fair and °delightsome, that- they might not be ‘enticing unto my people the Lord God did cause a 4skin of ‘blackness to come upon them.
22 And thus saith the Lord God: I will cause that they shall be “loath- some unto thy people, save they shall repent of their iniquities.
23 And cursed shall be the seed of him that “mixeth with their-seed; for they shall be cursed even with the same cursing. And the Lord spake it, and it was done.

25 And the Lord God said unto me: They shall be a scourge unto thy seed, to “stir them tip in remem- brance of me; and inasmuch as they will not remember me, and hearken unto my words, they shall scourge them even unto destruction.
26 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did “consecrate Jacob and Joseph, that they should be “priests and ‘teachers over the land of my people.
27 And it came to pass that we lived after the manner of “happiness.
28 *And thirty years had passed away from the time we left Jeru- salem.
29 And I, Nephi, had kept the "records upon my plates, which I had made, of my people thus far.
30 And it came to pass that the Lord God said unto me: “Make other plates; and thou shalt engraven many things upon them which are good in my sight, for the profit of thy people.
31 Wherefore, I, Nephi, to be obedient to the commandments of the Lord, went and made “these plates upon which I have engraven these things.
32 And I engraved that which is pleasing unto God. And if my people are pleased with the things of God they will be pleased with mine en- gravings which are upon theseplates.
33 And if my people desire to know the more particular part of the history of my people they must search mine “other "plates.

Jacob recounts Jewish history : Their Babylonian captivity and return ; the ministry and crucifixion of the Holy One of Israel; the help received from the gentiles; and their latter-day restoration when they believe in the Messiah.
- THE “words of Jacob, the brother
of Nephi, which he spake unto the people of Nephi:
2 Behold, my beloved brethren, I, Jacob, having been called of God, and ordained after the manner of his holy “order, and having been consecrated by my brother Nephi, unto whom ye look as a °king ora protector, and on whom ye depend for safety, behold ye know that I have spoken unto you exceedingly many things.
3 Nevertheless, I speak unto you again; for I am desirous for the *welfare of your souls. Yea, mine anxiety is great for you; and ye yourselves know that it ever has been. For I have exhorted you with all diligence; and I have taught you the words of my father; and I have spoken unto you concerning all things which are written, from the creation of the world.
4 And now, behold, I would speak unto you concerning things which are, and which are to come; where- fore, I will read you the words of “Isaiah. And they are the words which my brother has desired that I should speak unto you. And I speak unto you for your sakes, that ye may learn and glorify the name of your God.
5 And now, the words which I shall read are they which Isaiah spake concerning all the house of Israel;
Melchizedek.

wherefore, they may be “likened un- to you, for ye are of the house of Israel. And there are many things which have been spoken by Isaiah which may be likened unto you, because ye are of the house of Israel.
6 And _ now, these are the words: “Thus saith the Lord God: Behold, I will lift up mine hand to the Gentiles, and set up my standard to the people; and they shall bring thy sons in their arms, and thy daughters shall be carried ~upon their shoulders.
7 And “kings shall be thy nursing fathers, and their queens thy nurs- ing mothers; they shall bow down to thee with their faces towards the earth, and lick up the dust of thy feet; and thou shalt know that °I am the Lord; for they shall not be ashamed that ‘wait for me.
8 And now I, Jacob, would speak somewhat concerning these words. For behold, the Lord has shown me that those who were at “Jerusalem, from whence we came, have been ’slain and ‘carried away captive.
9 Nevertheless, the Lord has shown unto me that they should “return again. And he also has shown unto me that the Lord God, the Holy One of Israel, should manifest himself unto them in the flesh; and after he should manifest himself they should scourge him and °crucify him, according to the words of the angel who spake it unto me.
68
10 And after they have “hardened their hearts and °stiffened their necks against the Holy One of Israel, | behold, the ‘judgments of the Holy | One of Israel shall come upon them. | And the day cometh that they shall be smitten and afflicted.
11 Wherefore, after they are driven to and fro, for thus saith the angel, | many shall be afflicted in the flesh, ©
and shall not be suffered to “perish, |
because of the prayers of the faith- | ful; they shall be scattered, and smitten, and hated; nevertheless, the Lord will be merciful unto them, that ’when they shall come to the ‘knowledge of their Redeemer, they shall be ¢gathered together again to the ‘lands of their inheritance.
12 And blessed are the “Gentiles, they of whom the prophet has written; for behold, if it so be that they shall repent and fight not against Zion, and donot unite them- selves to that great and "abominable church, they shall be saved; for the Lord God will fulfil his ‘covenants which he has made unto his children; and for this cause the prophet has written these things.
13. Wherefore, they that fight against Zion and the covenant people of the Lord shall lick up the | dust of their feet; and the people of the Lord shall not be “ashamed. For the people of the Lord are they | who >wait for him; for they still wait |} for the coming of the Messiah. |

14 And behold, according to the words of the prophet, the Messiah will set himself again the “second time. to recover them; wherefore, he will “manifest himself unto them in power and great glory, unto the ‘destruction of their enemies, when that day cometh when they. shall believe in him; and none will he destroy that believe.in him.
15 And they that believe not in him shall be “destroyed, both by °fire, and by tempest, and by earth- quakes, and by ‘bloodsheds, and by 4pestilence, and -by °famine.. And they shall know: that the Lord is God, the Holy One of Israel.
16°For shall the prey be taken from the mighty, or the "lawful captive delivered?

*YEA, for thus saith the Lord: Have I put thee away, or have-I cast thee
_off forever? For thus saith the Lord:
Where is the °bill of your mother’s ‘divorcement? To whom have I put thee away, or to which of my 4creditors have I ‘sold you? Yea, to whom have I sold you? Behold, for your iniquities have ye sold your- selves, and for your transgressions is your mother put away.
2 Wherefore, when I came, there was no man; when I “called, yea, there was none to answer. O house of Israel, is my hand shortened at all that it cannot redeem, or have I no power to deliver? Behold, at my rebuke I °dry up the ‘sea, I make their “rivers a wilderness and their “fish to stink because the waters are dried up, and they die because of thirst.
3 I clothe the heavens with *black- ness, and_I make °sackcloth their covering.

6 I gave my back to the “smiter, and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair. I hid not my face from ’shame and spitting.

Jews shall be gathered in all their lands of promise—Atonement  ransoms man from the fall—The bodies of the dead shall come forth from the grave, and their spirits from hell and from paradise—They shall be judged— Atonement saves from death, hell, the devil, and~- endless torment—The righteous to be saved in the kingdom of God—Penalties for sins set forth— The Holy One of Israel is the keeper of the gate.
AND now, my beloved brethren, I have read these things that ye might know concerning the “covenants of the Lord that he has covenanted with all the house of Israel—
2 That he has spoken unto the Jews, by the mouth of his holy prophets, even from the beginning down, from generation to generation, until the time comes that they shall be “re-
72
stored to the true church and fold of God; when they shall be "gathered home to the ‘lands of their inheri- tance, and shall be established in all their lands of promise.
3 Behold, my beloved brethren, I speak unto you these things that ye may rejoice, and “lift up your heads forever, because of the blessings which the Lord God shall bestow upon your children.
4 For I know that ye have searched |
much, many of you, to know of things to come; wherefore I know that ye know that our “flesh must waste away and die; nevertheless, in our ’bodies we shall see God.
5 Yea, I know that ye know that in the body he shall show himself un- to those at Jerusalem, from whence we came; for it is expedient that it should be among them; for it be- hooveth the great “Creator that he osuffereth himself to become ‘subject unto man in the flesh, and “die for “all men, that all men might become subject unto him.
6 For as “death hath passed upon all men, to fulfil the merciful °plan of the great Creator, there must needs be a power of ‘resurrection, and the resurrection must needs come unto man by reason of the “fall; and the fall came by reason of ‘transgression; and because man became fallen they were ‘cut off from the “presence of the Lord.
7 Wherefore, it must needs be an
“infinite "atonement—save it should |}

8 O. the “wisdom of God, his ’mercy: and “grace! For behold, if the @flesh should rise no more our spirits must become subject to that angel who ‘fell from before the presence of the Eternal God, and became the ‘devil, to rise no more.
9 And our spirits must have be- come “like unto him, and we become devils, °angels to a ‘devil, to be 4shut out from the presence of our God, and to remain with the father of “lies, in misery, like unto himself; yea, to that being who ‘beguiled our first parents, who ’transformeth himself nigh unto an “angel of light, and ‘stirreth up the children of men unto ’secret combinations of murder and all manner of secret works of darkness.

11 And because of the way of *deliverance of our God, the Holy One of Israel, this °death, of which I have spoken, which is the temporal, shall deliver up its dead; which death is the grave.
12 And this “death of which I have spoken, which is the spiritual death, shall deliver up its dead; which spiritual death is "hell; wherefore, death and hell must ‘deliver up their dead, and hell must deliver up its 4captive “spirits, and the grave must deliver up its captive ‘bodies, and the bodies and the “spirits of men will be "restored one to the other; and it is by the power of the resur- rection of the Holy One of Israel.
13 O how great the “plan of our God! For on the other hand, the *’paradise of God must deliver up the spirits of the righteous, and the grave deliver up the body of the righteous; and the spirit and the body is ‘restored to itself again, and all men become incorruptible, and ‘immortal, and they are living souls, having a “perfect ‘knowledge like unto us in the flesh, save it be that our knowledge shall be perfect.

40 O, my beloved brethren, give ear to my words. Remember the greatness of the Holy One of Israel. Do not say that I have spoken hard things against you; for if ye do, ye will “revile against the °truth;. for I have spoken the words of your Maker. I know that the words of truth are ‘hard against all ¢unclean- ness; but the ‘righteous fear them
not, for they love the truth andare | not shaken. .

righteous. Behold, the °way for man_ ||
is ‘narrow, but it lieth in a straight course before him, and the keeper of | the ‘gate is the Holy One of Israel; and he employeth no servant there; and there is none other way save it be by the gate; for he cannot be deceived, for the Lord God is his name.

45 O, my beloved brethren, turn away from your sins; shake off the *chains of him that would bind you fast; come unto-that God who is the ’rock of your salvation.
46 Prepare your souls for that glorious day when “justice shall be administered unto the righteous, even the day of "judgment, that ye may not shrink with awful fear; that ye may not remember your awful °guilt in perfectness, and be con- strained to exclaim: Holy, holy are thy judgments, O Lord God @AI- mighty—but I know my guilt; I transgressed thy law, and my trans- gressions are mine; and the devil hath “obtained me, that I am a prey to his awful misery.
47 But: behold, my brethren, is it expedient that 1 should awake you to an awful reality of these things? Would I harrow up your souls if your minds were pure? Would I be plain unto you according to the plainness of the truth if ye were freed from sin?
48 Behold, if ye were holy I would speak unto you of holiness; but as ye are not holy, and ye look upon me as a “teacher, it must needs be expedient that I "teach you the consequences of sin.

49 Behold, my soul-abhorreth sin, and my heart “delighteth in right- eousness ; and I will "praise the holy name of my God.
50 Come, my brethren, every one that °thirsteth, come ye to the bwaters; and he that hath no ‘money, come buy and eat; yea, come buy wine and milk without money and without price.
51 Wherefore, do not spend money for that which is of no worth, nor your “labor for that which can- not ’satisfy. Hearken diligently unto me, and remember the words which I have spoken; and come unto the Holy One of Israel, and ‘feast upon that which perisheth not, neither can be corrupted, and let your soul delight in fatness.
52 Behold, my beloved brethren, remember. the words of your God; pray unto him continually by day, and give ‘thanks unto his holy name by night. Let your hearts "rejoice.
53 And behold how. great. the “covenants of the Lord, and how great his °condescensions unto the children of men; and because of his greatness, and his ‘grace and “mercy, he has promised unto us that our seed shall not utterly be destroyed, according to the flesh, but that he would “preserve them; and in future generations they shall become a righteous ‘branch unto the house of Israel.
54 And now, my brethren, I would speak unto you more; but on the morrow I will declare unto you the remainder of my words. Amen.

Jews shall crucify their God—They shall be scattered until they begin to believe in him—America shall be a land of liberty where no_king shall rule—Be reconciled to God and gain salvation through his grace.
AND now I, Jacob, speak unto you again, my beloved brethren, con- cerning this righteous *branch of which I have spoken.
2 For behold, the “promises which we have obtained are promises unto us according to the flesh; wherefore, as it has been shown unto me that many of our children shall perish in the flesh because of ’unbelief, never- theless, God will be merciful unto many; and our children shall be ‘restored, that they may come to that which will give them the true knowledge of their Redeemer.
3 Wherefore, as I said unto you, it must needs be expedient that Christ —for in the last night the “angel spake unto me that this should be his name—should 'come among the cJews, among those who are the more wicked part of the world; and they shall ¢crucify him—for thus it behooveth our God, and there is none other nation on earth that would ‘crucify their “God.
4 For should the mighty “miracles be wrought among other nations they would repent, and know that he be their God.

5 But because of “priestcrafts and iniquities, they at Jerusalem will stiffen their necks against him, that he be “crucified.
6 Wherefore, because of their iniquities, destructions, famines, “pestilences, and bloodshed shall come upon them; and they who shall not be destroyed shall be "scattered among all nations.
7 But behold, thus saith the *Lord God: "When the day cometh that they shall believe in me, that I am Christ, then have I covenanted with their fathers that they shall be ‘restored in the flesh, upon the earth, unto the “lands of their inheritance:
8 And it shall come to pass that they shall be “gathered in from their long dispersion, from the “isles of | the sea, and from the four parts of the earth; and the nations of the | Gentiles shall be great in the eyes of me, saith God, in ‘carrying them forth to the lands of their inheri- tance.
9 "Yea, the kings of the Gentiles shall be nursing fathers unto them, and their queens shall become nurs- ing mothers; wherefore, the ’prom- ises of the Lord are great unto the Gentiles, for he hath spoken-it, and who can dispute?

12 And I will fortify this land “against all other nations.
13 And he that “fighteth against Zion shall ’perish, saith God.
14 For he that raiseth up a “king against me shall perish, for I, the Lord, the "king of heaven, will be their king, and I will be a ‘light un- to them forever, that hear my words.
15 Wherefore, for this cause, that my “covenants may be fulfilled which I have made unto the children of men, that I will do unto them while they are in the flesh, I must needs destroy the ’secret works of ‘darkness, and of murders, and of abominations.
16 Wherefore, he that “fighteth against ’Zion, both Jew and Gentile, both bond and free, both male and female, ‘shali perish; for ¢they are they who are the ‘whore of all the earth; for ‘they who are /not for me are ‘against me, saith our God.
17 For I will “fulfil my promises which I have made unto the children of men, that I will do unto them while they are in the flesh—

19 Wherefore, I will ?%consecrate this land unto thy seed, and them who shall be numbered among thy seed, forever, for the land of their inheritance; for it is a choice land, saith God unto me, above all other lands, wherefore I will have all men that dwell thereon that they shall worship me, saith God.
20 And now, my beloved brethren, seeing that our merciful God has given us so great knowledge con- cerning these things, let us re- member him, and lay aside our sins, and not hang down our heads, for we are not cast off; nevertheless, we have been “driven out of the land of our inheritance; but we have been led to'a "better land, for the Lord has made the sea our ‘path, and we are upon an “isle of the sea.

CHAPTER 12
Isaiah sees the latter-day temple, gathering of Israel, and millennial judgment and peace—The proud and wicked shall be brought low at the Second Coming—Compare Isaiah 2.
"THE word that Isaiah, the son of Amoz, saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem:
2 And it shall come to pass in the last days, “when the ’mountain of the Lord’s ‘house shall be established in the top of the “mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills, and all nations shall flow unto it.
3 And many “people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the "mountain of the Lord, to the ‘house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will 4walk in his paths; for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.
4 And he shall “judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people: and they shall beat their swords into plow-shares, and their
2 NEPHI 11:8-12:12
spears into pruning-hooks—nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.
5 O house of Jacob, come ye and let us walk in the light of the Lord; yea, come, for ye have all “gone astray, every one to his °wicked ways.
6 Therefore, O Lord, thou hast forsaken thy people, the house of Jacob, because they be replenished from. the east, and hearken unto “soothsayers like the °Philistines, and they please themselves in the children of strangers. ~
7 Their land also is full of silver and gold, neither is there any end of their “treasures; their land is also full of horses, neither is there any end of their chariots.
8 Their land is also full of “idols; they worship the work of their own hands, that which their own fingers have made.
9 And the mean man “boweth "not down, and the great man humbleth himself not, therefore, forgive him not.
10 O ye wicked ones, enter into the rock, and “hide thee in the dust, for the fear of the Lord and the glory of his majesty shall smite thee.
11 And it shall come to pass that the “lofty looks of man shall be humbled, and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down, and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day.

2 NEPHI 12:13-13:8
Hosts soon cometh upon all nations, yea, upon every one; yea, upon the *proud and lofty, and upon every one who is lifted up, and he shall be brought low.
13 Yea, and the day of the Lord shall come upon all the *cedars of Lebanon, for they are high and lifted up; and upon all the oaks of Bashan;
14 And upon all the “high moun- tains, and upon all the hills, and upon all the nations which are lifted up, and upon every people;
15 And upon every “high tower, and upon every fenced wall;
16 And upon all the ships of the “sea, and upon all the ships of Tar- shish, and upon all pleasant pictures.
17 And the loftiness of man shall be bowed down, and the “haughti- ness of men shall be made low; and the Lord alone shall be exalted in *that day.
18 And the idols he shall utterly abolish.
19 And they shall go into the holes of the rocks, and into the caves of the earth, for the fear of the Lord shall come upon them and the “glory of his majesty shall smite them, when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth.
20 In that day a man shall cast his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which he hath made for himself to worship, to the moles and to the bats;
21 To go into the clefts of the rocks, and into the tops of the ragged rocks, for the fear of the Lord shall come upon them and the majesty of his glory shall smite them, when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth.
22 Cease ye from man, whose

CHAPTER 13
Judah and _ Jerusalem shall be punished for their disobedience—The Lord pleads for and judges his people —The daughters of Zion are cursed | and tormented for their worldliness— | Compare Isaiah 3.
“For behold, the Lord, the Lord | of Hosts, doth take away from | Jerusalem, and from Judah, the stay and the staff, the whole staff of bread, and the whole stay of water—
2 The “mighty man, and the man of war, the judge, and the prophet, and the ‘prudent, and the ancient;
3 The captain of fifty, and the honorable man, and the counselor, and the cunning artificer, and the eloquent orator.
4 And I will. give children unto them to be their princes, and babes shall rule over them.
5 And the people shall be “op- pressed, every one by another, and every one by his neighbor; the child shall behave himself 'proudly against the ancient, and the base against the honorable.
6 When a man shall take hold of his brother of the house of his father, and shall say: Thou hast clothing, be thou our ruler, and let not this ‘ruin come under thy hand—
7 In that day shall he swear, say- | ing: I will not be a healer; for in my house there is neither bread nor clothing; make me not a ruler of the people.

‘tongues and their doings have been against the Lord, to “provoke the eyes of his glory.
9 The show of their countenance doth witness against’ them, and doth declare their “sin to be even as *Sodom, and they cannot hide it. Wo unto their souls, for they have rewarded evil unto themselves !
10 Say unto the righteous that it is “well with them; for they shall "eat the fruit of their doings.
11 Wo unto the wicked, for they shall perish; for the reward of their hands shall be upon them!

13 The Lord standeth up to “plead, and standeth to judge the people.

15 What mean ye? Ye “beat my people to pieces, and grind the faces of the poor, saith the Lord God of Hosts. =
16 Moreover, the Lord saith: Because the daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk with stretched- forth necks and wanton eyes, walk- ing and mincing as they go, and making a tinkling with their feet—

18 In that ¢day the Lord will take away the bravery of their tinkling ornaments, and cauls, and round tires like the moon;

20 The bonnets, and the ornaments of the legs, and the headbands, and the tablets, and the ear-rings;

3 And it shall come to pass, they that are “left in Zion and remain in Jerusalem shall be called holy, every one that is written among the living in Jerusalem—
4 When the Lord shall have “washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from the midst thereof by the spirit of judgment and by the spirit of *burning.
5 And the “Lord will create upon every dwelling-place of mount Zion, and upon her assemblies, a ’cloud and smoke by day and the shining of a flaming fire by night; for upon all the glory of Zion shall be a defence.
6 And there shall be a tabernacle for a shadow in the daytime from the heat, and for a place of “refuge, and a covert from storm and from rain.
CHAPTER 15
The Lord’s vineyard (Israel) shall become desolate and his people shall be scattered—Woes shall come upon them in their apostate and scattered state—The Lord shall lift an ensign and gather Israel—Compare Isaiah 5.
“AND then will I sing to my well- beloved a song of my beloved, touch- ing his vineyard. My well-beloved hatha vineyard ina very fruitful hill.
2 And he fenced it, and gathered out the stones thereof, and planted it with the choicest “vine, and built a tower in the midst of it, and also made a wine-press therein; and he looked that it should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes.

5 And now go to; I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard—I will “take away the hedge thereof, and it shall be eaten up; and I will break-down the wall thereof, and it shall be trodden down;
6 And I will lay it waste; it shall not be pruned nor digged; but there shall come up “briers and thorns; I will also command the clouds that they "rain no rain upon it.

Isaiah sees the Lord—lIsaiah’s sins are forgiven—He is called to prophesy —He prophesies of the rejection by the Jews of Christ’s teachings—A rem- nant shall return—Compare Isaiah 6.
“IN the "year that king Uzziah died, 1 ‘saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple.
2 Above it stood the “seraphim; each one had six wings; with twain hecovered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he did fly.
3 And one cried unto another, and said: Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of Hosts; the whole earth is full of his “glory.
4 And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke.
5 Then said I: Wo is unto me! for I am undone; because I ama man of unclean lips; and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips; for mine eyes have “seen the King, the Lord of Hosts.
6 Then flew one of the seraphim unto me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar;
7 And he laid it upon my mouth, and said: Lo, this has touched thy lips; and thine “iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged.

4 And say unto him:.Take heed, and be quiet; fear not, neither be faint-hearted for the two tails of these smoking firebrands, for the fierce anger of Rezin with Syria, and of the son of Remaliah.
5 Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah, have taken evil counsel against thee, saying:
6 Let us go up against Judah and vex it, and let us make a breach therein for us, and set a king in the midst of it, yea, the son of Tabeal.
7 Thus saith the Lord God: It shall not stand, neither shall it come to pass.
8 For the head of Syria is Damas- cus, and the head of Damascus, Rezin; and within three score and five years shall Ephraim be “broken that it be not a people.
9 And the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is Remaliah’s son. If ye will “not believe surely ye shall not be established.
10 Moreover, the Lord spake again unto Ahaz, saying:
11 Ask thee a “sign of the Lord thy God; ask it either in the depths, or in the heights above.
12 But Ahaz said: I will not ask, neither will I “tempt the Lord.
13 And he said: Hear ye now, O house of David; is it a small thing for you to weary men, but will ye weary my God also?

9 “Associate yourselves, O ye people, and ye shall be broken in pieces; and give ear all ye of far countries; gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces; gird your- selves, and ye shall be broken in pieces.
10 Take counsel together, and it shall come to naught; speak the word, and it shall not stand; for God is with us.
11 For the Lord spake thus to me with a strong hand, and instructed me that I should not walk in the way of this people, saying:
12 Say ye not, A confederacy, to all to whom this people shall say, A “confederacy ; neither fear ye their fear, nor be afraid.
13 Sanctify the Lord of Hosts him- self, and let him be your fear, and let him be your dread.
14 And he shall be for a sanctuary ; but for a “stone of ’stumbling, and for a ‘rock of ¢offense to both the houses of Israel, foragin anda “snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.

that peep and mutter—‘should not a people seek unto their God for the living to hear from the dead?
20 To the “law and to the testi- mony ; and if they speak not accord- ing to this word, it is because there is no light in them.
21 And they shall pass through it hardly bestead and hungry; and it shall come to pass that when they shall be hungry, they shall fret themselves, and curse their king and their God, and look upward.
22 And they shall look unto the earth and behold trouble, and “dark- ness, dimness of anguish, and shall be driven to darkness.
CHAPTER 19
Isaiah speaks Messianically—The people in darkness to see a great Light —Unto us a child is born—He shall be the Prince of Peace and shall reign on David's throne—Compare Isaiah 9.
“NEVERTHELESS, the dimness shall not be such as was in her vexation, when at first he lightly afflicted the ‘and of ‘Zebulun, and the land of ¢Naphtali, and afterwards_did more grievously afflict by the way of the Red Sea beyond Jordan in Galilee of the nations.
2 The people that walked in dark- ness have seen a great light; they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death, upon them hath the light shined.
3 Thou hast multiplied the nation, and “increased the joy—they joy before thee according to the joy in harvest, and as men rejoice when they divide the spoil.
4 For thou hast broken the yoke of

5 For every battle of the warrior is with confused noise, and garments rolled in blood; but “this shall be with burning and fuel of fire.
6 For unto us a “child is born, unto us a son is given; and the °govern- ment shall be upon his shoulder; and his name shall be called, Wonderful, Counselor, The “Mighty God, The 4Everlasting Father, The Prince of ¢Peace.
7 Of the increase of “government and peace °’there is no end, upon the throne of “David, and upon his kingdom to order it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth, even forever. The zeal of the Lord of Hosts will per- form this.
8 The Lord sent his word unto Jacob and it hath lighted upon Israel.
9 And all the people shall know, even Ephraim and the inhabitants of Samaria, that say in the pride and stoutness of heart:
10 The bricks are fallen down, but we will build with hewn “stones; the sycamores are cut down, but we will change them into ’cedars.
11 Therefore the Lord shall set up the: adversaries of “Rezin against him, and join his enemies together;
12 The Syrians before and the Philistines behind; and they shall *devour Israel with open mouth. For all this his "anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.

kingdoms of the idols, and whose graven images did excel them of Jerusalem and of Samaria;
11 Shall I not, as I have done unto Samaria and her “idéis, so do to Jerusalem and to her idols?
12 Wherefore it shall come to pass that when the Lord hath performed his whole work upon Mount Zion and upon Jerusalem, I will punish the fruit-of the stout heart of the king of “Assyria, and the glory of his high looks.
13 For “he saith: By the strength of ’my hand and by my wisdom I have done these things; for 1am prudent; and I have moved the borders of the people, and have robbed their treasures, and I have put down the inhabitants like a valiant man;
14 And my hand hath found as a nest the riches of the people; and as one gathereth eggs that are left have I gathered all the earth; and there was none that moved the wing, or opened the mouth, or peeped.
15 Shall the “ax boast itself against him that heweth therewith? Shall the saw magnify itself against him that shaketh it? As if the rod should shake itself against them that lift it up, or as if the staff should lift up itself as if it were no wood!
16 Therefore shall the Lord, the Lord of Hosts, send among his fat ones, leanness; and under his glory he shall kindle a burning like the burning of a fire.
17 And thelight of Israel shall be for a “fire, and his Holy One fora flame, and shall burn. and shall devour his thorns and his briers in one day;
2 NEPHI 20:11-26
18 And shall consume the glory_of his forest, and of his fruitful field, both soul and body; and they shall be as when a standard-bearer fainteth.
19 And the “rest of the trees of his forest shall be few, that a child may write them.
20 And it shall come to pass in that day, that the remnant of Israel, and such as are escaped of the “house of Jacob, shall no more again °stay upon him that smote them, but shall stay upon the Lord, the Holy One of Israel, in truth.
21 The “remnant shall return, yea, even the remnant of Jacob, unto the mighty God.
22 For though thy people “Israel be as the sand of the sea, yet a remnant of them shall return; the “consumption decreed shall overflow with righteousness.
23 For the Lord God of Hosts shall make a “consumption, even deter- mined in all the land.
24 Therefore, thus saith the Lord God of Hosts: O my people that dwellest in Zion, “be not afraid of the Assyrian; he shall smite thee with a rod, and shall lift up his staff against thee, after the "manner of Egypt.
25 For yet a very little while, and the “indignation shall cease, and mine anger in their destruction.
26 And the Lord of Hosts shall ¢stir up a scourge for him according to the slaughter of "Midian at the rock of Oreb; and as his rod was upon the sea_so shall he lift it up after the manner of ‘Egypt.

22 And the wild beasts of the islands shall cry in their desolate houses, and dragons in their pleasant palaces; and her time is near to come, and. her day shall not be prolonged. For I will destroy her speedily; yea, for I will be merci- ful unto my people, but the wicked shall perish.

2 And the people shall take them and bring them to their place; yea, from far unto the ends of the earth; and they shall return to their “lands of promise.

Messiah—He shall first come six hundred years after Lehi left Jeru- salem—Nephites keep the law of Moses and believe in Christ, who is the Holy One of Israel:
Now I, Nephi, do speak somewhat concerning the words which I have written, which have been spoken by the mouth of Isaiah. For behold, Isaiah spake many things which were “hard for many of my people to understand; for they know not con- cerning the manner of prophesying among the Jews.
2 For I, Nephi, have not taught them many things concerning the manner of the Jews; for their ?works were works of darkness, and their doings were doings of abominations.
3 Wherefore, I write unto my people, unto all those that shall receive hereafter these things which I write, “that they may know the judgments of God, that they come upon all nations, according to the word which he hath spoken.
4 Wherefore, hearken, O my people, which are of the house of Israel, and give ear unto my words; for because the words of Isaiah are not plain unto you, nevertheless they are plain unto all those that are filled with the “spirit of (prophecy. But I give unto you a “prophecy, accord- ing to the spirit which is in me; wherefore I shall prophesy accord- ing to the “plainness which hath been with me from the time that I came out from Jerusalem with my father; for behold, my soul delighteth in ¢plainness unto my people, that they may learn.

the words of “Isaiah, for I came out from Jerusalem, and mine eyes hath beheld the things of the “Jews, and I know that the Jews do*understand the things of the prophets, and there is none other people that understand the things which were spoken unto the Jews like unto them, save it be that they are taught after the man- ner of the things of the Jews.
6 But behold, I, Nephi, have not taught my children after the manner of the Jews; but behold, I, of my- self, have dwelt at Jerusalem, where- fore I know concerning the regions round about; and I have made mention unto my children concern- ing the judgments of God, which “hath come to pass among the Jews, unto my children, according to all that which Isaiah hath spoken, and I do not write them.
7 But behold, I proceed with mine own prophecy, according to my “plainness; in the which I "know that no man can err; nevertheless, in the days that the prophecies of Isaiah shall be fulfilled men shall know of a surety, at the times when they shall come to pass.
8 Wherefore, they are of “worth unto the children of men, and he that supposeth that they are not, unto them will I speak particularly, and confine the words unto mine *’own people; for I know that they shall be of great worth unto them in the ‘last days; for in that day shall they understand them; wherefore, for their good have I written them.

10 Wherefore, it hath been told them concerning the destruction which should come upon them, im- mediately after my father left °Jeru- salem; nevertheless, they "hardened their hearts; and according to my prophecy they have been destroyed, save it be those which are ‘carried away “captive into Babylon.
11 And now this I speak because of the “spirit which is in me. And not- withstanding they have been carried away they shall return again, and possess the land of Jerusalem; wherefore, they shall be "restored again to the ‘land of their inheri- tance.
12 But, behold, they shall have “wars, and rumors of wars; and when the day cometh that the °Only Begotten of the Father, yea, even the Father of heaven and of earth, shall ‘manifest himself unto them in the flesh, behold, they will reject him, because of their iniquities, and the hardness of their hearts, and the stiffness of their necks.

Wherefore, my soul delighteth to prophesy con- | cerning him, for I have “seen his day, | and my heart doth magnify his holy name. | 14 And behold it shall come to pass that after the “Messiah hath risen | from the dead, and hath manifested | himself unto his people, unto as many as will believe on his name, | behold, Jerusalem shall be °destroy- | ed again; for ‘wo unto them that || fight against God and the people of || his ¢church. | 15 Wherefore, the “Jews shall be || *scattered among all nations; yea, and also ‘Babylon shall be de- stroyed; wherefore, the Jews shall | be scattered by other nations. 16 And after they have been | "scattered, and the Lord God hath || scourged them by other nations | for the space of many generations, |} yea, even down from generation | to generation until they shall be |} persuaded to "believe in Christ, the ||/ Son of God, and the atonement, ||| which is infinite for all mankind— }/

that he should "heal the nations after they had been bitten by the poisonous serpents, if they would cast their eyes unto the ‘serpent which he did raise up before them, and also gave him power that he should smite the “rock and the water should come forth; yea, behold I say unto you, that as these things are ‘true, and as the Lord God liveth, there is none other ‘name given under heaven save it be this Jesus Christ, of which I have spoken, whereby man can be saved.
21 Wherefore, for this cause hath the Lord God promised unto me that these things which I “write shall be kept and preserved, and handed down unto my seed, from generation to generation, that the promise may be fulfilled unto Joseph, that his seed should never "perish as long as the earth should stand.
22 Wherefore, these things shall go from generation to generation as long as the earth shall stand; and they shall go according to the will and pleasure of God; and the nations who shall possess them shall be %judged of them according to the words which are written.

14 But behold, I prophesy unto you concerning the “last days; con- cerning the days when the Lord God shall bring these things forth unto the children of men.
15 After my seed and the seed of my brethren shall have “dwindled in unbelief, and shall have been smitten by the Gentiles; yea, after the Lord God shall have ’camped against them round about, and shall have laid siege against them with a mount, and raised forts against them; and after they shall have been brought down low in the dust, even that they are not, yet the words of the righteous shall be written, and the ‘prayers of the faithful shall be heard, and all those who have 4qwindled in unbelief shall not be forgotten.
16 For those who shall be destroyed shall “speak unto them out of the ground, and their speech shall be low out of the dust, and their voice shall be as one that hath a familiar spirit; for the Lord God will give unto him power, that he may whisper concerning them, even as it were out of the ground; and their speech shall whisper out of the dust.

19 And it shall come to pass, that | those who have dwindled in un- | belief shall be *smitten by the hand of the Gentiles.
20 And the Gentiles are lifted up in the “pride of their eyes, and have ’stumbled, because of the greatness | of their ‘stumbling block, that they have built up many ¢churches; nevertheless, they ‘put down the
power and miracles of God, and | preach up unto themselves their |
own wisdom and their own ‘learning, that they may get gain and grind upon the face of the poor.

23 For behold, my beloved breth- ren, I say unto you that the Lord God worketh not in ¢darkness.
24 He doeth not “anything save it be for the benefit of the world; for he “loveth the world, even that he layeth down his own life that he may draw ‘all men unto him. Wherefore, he commandeth none that they shall not partake of his salvation.
25 Behold, doth he cry unto any, saying: Depart from me? Behold, I say unto you, Nay; but he saith: *Come unto me all ye "ends of the earth, ‘buy milk and honey, without money and without price.
26 Behold, hath he commanded any that they should “depart out of the synagogues, or out of the houses of worship? Behold, I say unto you, Nay.
27 Hath he commanded any that they should not partake of his *salvation? Behold I say unto you, Nay; but he hath given it free for all men; and he hath commanded his people that they should persuade all men to ‘repentance.
28 Behold, hath the Lord com- manded any that they should not partake of his goodness? Behold I say unto you, Nay; but “all men are privileged the one “like unto the other, and none are forbidden.

29 He commandeth that there shall be no 4“priestcrafts; for, behold, priestcrafts are that men preach and set °themselves up for a light unto the world, that they may get ‘gain and “praise of the world; but they seek not the ‘welfare of Zion.
30 Behold, the Lord hath forbidden this thing; wherefore, the Lord God hath given a commandment that all men should have “charity, which *charity is ‘love. And except they should have charity they were nothing. Wherefore, if they should have charity they would not suffer the laborer in Zion to perish.
31 But the “laborer in °Zion shall labor for Zion; for if they labor for ‘money they shall perish.
32 And again, the Lord God hath *commanded that-men should not murder; that they should not lie; that they should not °steal; that they should not take the name of the Lord their God in ‘vain; that they should not “envy; that they should not have ‘malice; that they should not contend one with another; that they. should not commit ‘whore- doms; and that they should do none of these things; for whoso doeth them shall perish.
33 For none of. these iniquities come of the Lord; for he doeth that which is good among the children of men; and he doeth nothing save it be plain unto the children of men; and he “inviteth them "all to “come unto him and partake of his good- ness ; and he ¢denieth none that come

12 Wherefore, at that day when the book shall be delivered unto the man of whom I have spoken, the book shall be hid from the eyes of the world, that the eyes of none shall behold it save it be that *three witnesses shall behold it, by the power of God, besides him to whom the book shall be delivered; and they shall testify to:\the truth of the book and the things: therein:
13 And there is “none other which shall view it, save it bea few accord- ing to the will of God, to bear testimony of his word unto the children of men; for the Lord God hath said that the words of the faithful should speak as if it were >from the dead.
14 Wherefore, the Lord God will proceed to bring forth the words of the book; and in the mouth of as many witnesses as seemeth him good will he establish his word; and wo be unto. him that “rejecteth the word of God!
15 But behold, it shall come to pass that the Lord God shall say unto him to whom he shall deliver the

17 And the man shall say: I cannot bring the book, for it is sealed.
18 Then shall the learned say: I cannot read it.
19 Wherefore it shall come to pass, that the Lord God will ‘deliver again the book and the words thereof to him that is not learned; and the man that is'not learned shall say: I am not learned.
20 Then shall the Lord God say unto him: The learned shall not read them, for they have rejected them, and I am “able to do mine own work; wherefore thou shalt read the words which I shall give unto thee.

16 Wo unto them that “turn aside the just for a thing of naught and ’revile against that-which is good, and say that itis of no worth! Forthe day shall come that the Lord God will speedily visit the inhabitants of the earth; and in that day that they are ‘fully ripe in iniquity they shall perish.
17 But behold, if the inhabitants of the earth shall repent of their wickedness and abominations they shall not be destroyed, saith the Lord of Hosts.
18 But behold, that great and “abominable church, the °whore of all the earth, must ‘tumble to the
108
earth, and great must be the fall thereof.
19 For the kingdom of the devil must “shake, and they which belong
to it must needs be stirred up unto |
repentance, or the devil will grasp them with his everlasting ‘chains, and they be stirred up to anger, and perish;
20 For behold, at that day shall he | “rage in the "hearts of the children of men, and stir them up to anger against that which is good.
21 And others will he “pacify, and lull them away into carnal "security, that they will say: All is well in Zion; yea, Zion prospereth, all is well—and thus the ‘devil ¢cheateth their souls, and leadeth them away carefully down to hell.
22 And behold, others he“flattereth away, and telleth them there is no "hell; and he saith unto them: I'am no devil, for there is none—and thus he whispereth in their ears, until he grasps them with his awful ‘chains, from whence there is no deliverance.
23 Yea, they are grasped with death, and hell; and death, and hell, and the devil, and all that have been | seized therewith must stand before the throne of God, and be “judged according to their works, from whence they must go into the place prepared for them, even a °lake of fire and brimstone, which is endless torment.
24 Therefore, wo be unto him that is at “ease in Zion!

4 But thus saith the Lord God: O fools, they shall have a “Bible; and it shall proceed forth from the ’Jews, mine ancient covenant people. And what ‘thank they the 4Jews for the Bible which they receive from them? Yea, what do the Gentiles mean? Do they remem- ber the travails, and the labors, and the pains of the Jews, and their diligence unto me, in bringing forth salvation unto the Gentiles?
5 O ye Gentiles, have ye re- membered the Jews, mine ancient covenant people? Nay; but ye have 2cursed them, and have "hated them, and have not sought to recover them. But behold, I will return all these things upon your own heads; for I the Lord have not forgotten my people.

3 And now, I would prophesy somewhat more concerning the Jews and the Gentiles. For after the book of which I have spoken shail come forth, and be written unto the Gentiles, and sealed up again unto the Lord, there shall be many which shall “believe the words which are written; and "they shall carry them forth unto the ‘remnant of our seed.

baptism are the gate to the strait and narrow path—Eternal life comes to those who keep the commandments after baptism.
AND now I, Nephi, make an end of my “prophesying unto you, my beloved brethren. And I cannot write but a few things, which I know must surely come to.pass; neither can I write but a few of the "words of my brother Jacob.
2 Wherefore, the things which I
have written sufficeth me, save it be a few words which I “must speak concerning the doctrine of Christ; wherefore, I shall speak unto you plainly, according to the plainness of my prophesying. '3 For my soul delighteth in “plain- ness; for after this manner doth the Lord God work among the children of men. For the Lord God giveth light unto the °understanding; for he speaketh unto men according to their ‘language, unto their under- standing.
4 Wherefore, I would that yeshould remember that I have spoken unto you concerning that “prophet which the Lord showed unto me, that should baptize the "Lamb of God, which should take away the sins of the world.
5 And now, if the Lamb of God, he being “holy, should have need to be ’baptized by water, to fulfil all righteousness, O then, how much more need have we, being unholy, to be ‘baptized, yea, even by water!
6 And now, I would ask of you, my beloved brethren, wherein the Lamb
2 NEPHI 31:1-13
of God did fulfil all righteousness in being baptized by water?
7 Know-ye not that he was holy? But notwithstanding he being holy, he showeth unto the children of men that, according to the flesh he humbleth himself before the Father, and witnesseth unto the Father that he would be “obedient unto him in keeping his commandments.
8 Wherefore, after he was baptized with water the Holy Ghost descend- ed upon him in the “form of a ’dove.
9 And again, it showeth unto the children of men the straitness of the path, and the narrowness of the *gate, by which they should enter, he having set the "example before them.
10 And he said unto the children of men: “Follow thou me. Where- fore, my beloved brethren, can we >follow Jesus save we shall be willing to keep the commandments of the Father?
11 And the Father said: Repent ye, repent ye, and be baptized in the name of my Beloved Son.
12 And also, the voice of the Son came unto me, saying: He that is baptized in my name, to him will the Father “give the Holy Ghost, like unto me; wherefore, "follow me, and do the things which ye have seen me do.
13 Wherefore, my beloved breth- ren, I know that if ye shall “follow the Son, with full purpose of heart, acting no "hypocrisy and no decep- tion before God, but with real ‘in- tent, repenting of your sins, witness- ing unto the Father that ye are Iwilling to take upon you the “name

14 But, behold, my beloved breth- ren, thus came the voice of the Son unto me, saying: After ye have re- pented of your sins, and witnessed unto the Father that ye are willing to keep my commandments, by the baptism of water, and have received the baptism of fire and of the Holy Ghost, and can speak with a new tongue, yea, even with the tongue of angels, and after this should “deny me, it would have been °better for you that ye had not known me.
15 And I heard a voice from the Father, saying: Yea, the “words of my Beloved are true and faithful. He that ’endureth to the ‘end, the same shall be saved.
16 And now, my beloved brethren, I know by this that unless a man shall “endure to the end, in following the "example of the Son of the living God, he cannot be saved.

wherefore, ye are not brought into the light, but must perishin the dark.
5 For behold, again I say unto you that if ye will enter in by the way, and receive the Holy Ghost, it will “show unto you all things what ye should do.
6 Behold, this is the doctrine of Christ, and there will be- no more doctrine given until after he shall “manifest himself unto you in the flesh. And when he shall manifest himself unto you in the flesh, the things which he shall say unto you shall ye observe to do.
7 And now I, Nephi, cannot say more; the Spirit stoppeth mine utterance, and I am left to mourn because of the “unbelief, and the wickedness, and the ignorance, and the °’stiffmeckedness of men; for they will ‘not search “knowledge, nor understand great knowledge, when it is given unto them in “plain- ness, even as plain as word can be.
8 And now, my beloved brethren, I perceive that ye ponder still in your hearts; and it grieveth me that I must speak concerning this thing. For if ye would hearken unto the “Spirit which teacheth a man to ’pray ye would know that ye must ‘pray; for the “evil spirit teacheth not aman to pray, but teacheth him that he must not pray.

Nephi’s words are true—They testify of Christ—T hose who believe in Christ will believe Nephi’s words—They shall stand as a witness before the judgment bar.
AND now I, Nephi, cannot write all the things which were taught among my people; neither am I “mighty in writing, like unto speaking; for when a man "speaketh by the power of the Holy Ghost the power of the Holy Ghost carrieth it unto the hearts of the children of men.
2 But behold, there are many that “harden their ’hearts against the Holy ‘Spirit, that it hath no place in them; wherefore, they cast many things away which-are written and esteem them as things of naught.
3 But I, Nephi, have written what I have written, and I esteem it as of great “worth, and especially unto my people. For I pray continually for them by day, and mine ‘eyes water my pillow by night, because of them; and I cry unto my Godin faith, and I know that he will hear my cry.

the people of Nephi.
CHAPTER 1
Jacob and Joseph seek to persuade men to believe in Christ and keep his commandments—Ne phi dies—Wick- edness prevails among the Nephites.
OR behold, it came to pass that fk *fifty and five years had passed away from the time that Lehi left Jerusalem; wherefore, Nephi gave me, Jacob, a “commandment
concerning the ’small plates, upon which these things are engraven.
2 And he gave me, Jacob, a com- mandment that I should “write upon *these plates a few of the things which. I considered to be most precious; that I should not touch, save it were lightly, concerning the history of this people which are called the people of Nephi.

people should be engraven upon his “other plates, and that I should "pre- serve these plates and hand them down unto my seed, from generation to generation.
4 And if there were preaching which was “sacred, or revelation which was great, or prophesying, that I should engraven the "heads of them upon these plates, and touch upon them as much as it were possible, for Christ’s sake, and for the sake of our people.
5 For because of faith and great anxiety, it truly had been made manifest unto us concerning our people, what things should “happen unto them.
6 And we also had many revela- tions, and the spirit of much proph- ecy; wherefore, we knew of “Christ and his kingdom, which should come.
7 Wherefore we labored diligently among our people, that we might persuade them to “come unto Christ, and partake of the goodness of God, that they might enter into his "rest, lest by any means he should swear in his wrath they should not ‘enter in, as in the “provocation in the days of temptation while the children of Israel were in the ‘wilderness.
8 Wherefore, we would to God that we could persuade all men “not to rebel against God, to ’provoke him to anger, but that all men would believe in Christ, and view his death, and suffer his “cross and bear the shame of the world; wherefore, I,

Jacob, take it upon me to fulfil the commandment of my brother Nephi.
9 Now Nephi began to be old, and he saw that he must soon ‘die; wherefore, he “anointed a man to be © a king and a ruler over his people now, according to the reigns of the ckings.
10. The people having loved Nephi | exceedingly, he having been a great protector for them, having wielded the “sword of Laban in their defence, and having labored in all his days for their welfare—
11 Wherefore, the people were desirous to retain in remembrance his name. And whoso should reign in his stead were called by the people, second Nephi, third Nephi, and so forth, according to the reigns of the kings; and thus they were called — by the people, let them be of what- ever name they would.
i2 And it came to pass that Nephi died.
13 Now the people which were not “Lamanites were Nephites; never- theless, they were called Nephites, Jacobites, Josephites, ’Zoramites, Lamanites, Lemuelites, and Ish- maelites.
14 But I, Jacob, shall not hereafter distinguish “them by these names, but I shall call them Lamanites that seek to destroy the people of Nephi, and those who are friendly to Nephi | I shall call “"Nephites, or the “people of Nephi, according to the reigns of | the kings.

15 And now it came to pass that the people of Nephi, under the reign of the second king, began to grow hard in their hearts, and indulge themselves somewhat in wicked practices, such as like unto David of old desiring many “wives and °concubines, and also Solomon, his son.
16 Yea, and they also began to search much “gold and silver, and began, to be lifted up somewhat in pride.
17 Wherefore I, Jacob, gave unto them these words as I taught them in the “temple, having first obtained mine ’errand from the Lord.
18 For I, Jacob, and my brother Joseph had been “consecrated priests and ’teachers of this people, by the hand of Nephi.
19 And we did “magnify our office unto the Lord, taking upon us the ’responsibility, answering the sins of the people upon our own heads if we did not ‘teach them the word of God with all diligence; wherefore, by laboring with our might their %blood might not come upon our garments; otherwise their blood would come upon our garments,
and we would not be found spotless
at the last day.

THE “words which Jacob, the brother of Nephi, spake unto the people of Nephi, after the death of Nephi:
2 Now, my beloved brethren, I, Jacob, according to the “responsi- bility which I am under to God, to b’magnify mine office with “soberness, and that Imight “rid my garments of your sins, I come up into the temple this day that I might declare unto you the word of God.
3 And ye yourselves know that I have hitherto been diligent in the office of my calling; but I this day am weighed down with much more desire and anxiety for the “welfare of your souls than I have hitherto been.
4 For behold, as yet, ye have been obedient unto the word of the Lord, which I have given unto you.
5 But behold, hearken ye unto me, and know that by the help of the all- powerful Creator. of heaven and earth I can tell you concerning your “thoughts, how that ye are beginning to labor in sin, which sin appeareth very abominable unto me, yea, and abominable unto God.
6 Yea, it grieveth my soul and causeth me to shrink with shame before the presence of my Maker, that I must testify unto you con- cerning the wickedness of your hearts.
7 And also it grieveth me that I must use so much “boldness of speech concerning you, before your wives and your children, many of whose feelings are exceedingly tender and chaste and delicate

before God, which thing is pleasing unto God;
8 And it supposeth me that they have come up hither to hear the pleasing “word of God, yea, the word which healeth the wounded soul.
9 Wherefore, it burdeneth my soul that I should be constrained, be- cause of the strict commandment which I have received from God, to “admonish you according to your crimes, to enlarge the wounds of those who are already wounded, instead of consoling and healing their wounds; and those who have not been wounded, instead of feast- ing upon the pleasing word of God have daggers placed to pierce their souls and wound their delicate minds.
10 But, notwithstanding the great- ness of the task, I must do according to the strict “commands of God, and tell you concerning your wickedness and abominations, in the presence of the pure in heart, and the broken heart, and under the glance of the opiercing eye of the Almighty God.
11 Wherefore, I must tell you the truth according to the “plainness of the "word of God. For behold, as I inquired of the Lord, thus came the word unto me, saying: Jacob, get thou up into the temple on the morrow, and declare the word which I shall give thee unto this people.
12 And now behold, my brethren, this is the word which I declare unto you, that many of you have begun to search for gold, and for silver, and for all manner of pre- cious “ores, in the which this land,

20 And now, my brethren, I have spoken unto you concerning pride; and those of you which have afflicted your neighbor, and persecuted him because ye were proud in your hearts, of the things which God hath given you, what say ye of it?
21 Do ye not suppose that such things are abominable unto him who created all flesh? And the one being is as precious in his sight as the other. And all flesh is of the dust; and for the selfsame end hath he created them, that they should keep his “commandments and_ glorify him forever.
22 And now I make an end of speaking unto you concerning this pride. And were it not that I must speak unto you concerning a grosser crime, my heart would rejoice ex- ceedingly because of you.
23 But the word of God burdens me because of your grosser crimes. For behold, thus saith the Lord: This people begin to wax in iniquity ; they understand not the-scriptures, for they seek to excuse themselves in committing “whoredoms, because of the things which were written con- cerning David, and Solomon his son.
24 Behold, David and. *Solomon truly had many °wives and con- cubines, which thing was ‘abomin- able before me, saith the Lord.

unto me a “righteous branch from the fruit of the loins of Joseph.
26 Wherefore, I the Lord God will not suffer that this people shall do like unto them of old.
27 Wherefore, my brethren, hear me, and hearken to the word of the Lord: For there shall not any “man among you have save it be "one ‘wife; and concubines he shall have none;
28 For I, the Lord God, delight in the “chastity of women. And °whore- doms are an abomination before me; thus saith the Lord of Hosts.
29 Wherefore, this people shall keep my commandments, saith the Lord of Hosts, or “cursed be the land for their sakes.
30 For if I will, saith the Lord of Hosts, raise up “seed unto me, I will command my people; otherwise they shall hearken unto these things.
31 For behold, I, the Lord, have seen the sorrow, and heard the mourning of the daughters of my people in the land of Jerusalem, yea, and in all the lands of my people, because of the wickedness and “abominations of their "husbands.
32 And I-will not suffer, saith the Lord of Hosts, that the cries of the fair daughters of this people, which I have led out of the land of Jerusalem, shall come up unto me against the men of my people, saith the Lord of Hosts.
33. For they shall not lead away captive the daughters of my people because of their tenderness, save I shall. visit them with a sore curse, even unto destruction; for they shall not commit “whoredoms, like unto

them of old, saith the Lord of Hosts.
34 And now behold, my brethren, ye know that these commandments were given to our “father, Lehi; wherefore, ye have known them be- fore; and ye have come unto great condemnation; for ye have done these things which ye ought not to have done.
35 Behold, ye have done “greater iniquities than the Lamanites, our brethren. Ye have broken the hearts of your tender wives, and lost the confidence of your children, because of your bad examples before them; and the sobbings of their hearts ascend up to God against you. And because of the ’strictness of the word of God, which cometh down against you, many hearts died, pierced with deep wounds.
CHAPTER 3°
The pure in heart receive the pleasing word of God—Lamanite righteousness exceeds that of Nephites—Jacobwarns against fornication, lasciviousness, and every sin.
Bur behold, I, Jacob, would speak unto you that are pure in heart. Look unto God with firmness of mind, and “pray unto him with ex- ceeding faith, and he will °console you in your ‘afflictions, and he will plead your cause, and send down 4justice upon those who seek your destruction.
2 O all ye that are pure in heart, lift up your heads and receive the pleasing word of God, and’ feast
122
upon his “love; for ye may, if your ’minds are ‘firm, forever. 5
3 But, wo, wo, unto you that are not pure in heart, that are filthy this day before God; for except ye repent the land is “cursed for your sakes; and the Lamanites, which are not "filthy like unto you, nevertheless they are ‘cursed with a sore cursing, shall scourge you even unto destruction.
4 And the time speedily cometh, that except ye repent they shall possess the land of your inheritance, and the Lord God will “lead away the righteous out from among you.
5 Behold, the Lamanites. your brethren, whom ye hate because of their filthiness and the cursing which hath come upon their skins, are more righteous than you; for they have not “forgotten the command- ment of the Lord, which was given unto our father—that they should have save it were °one wife, and ‘concubines they should have none, and there should not be ?whoredoms committed among them.
6 And now, this commandment they observe to keep; wherefore, because of this observance, in keep- ing this commandment, the Lord God will not destroy them, but will be “merciful unto them; and one day they shall °become a blessed people.
7 Behold, their “husbands "love their ‘wives, and their wives love their husbands; and their husbands and their wives love their children; and their ‘unbelief and their hatred towards you is because of the in- iquity of their fathers; wherefore,

how much better are you than they, in the sight of your great Creator?
8 O my brethren, I fear that unless ye shall repent of your sins that their skins will be *whiter than yours, when ye shall be brought with them before the throne of God.
9 Wherefore, a commandment. I give unto you, which is the word of God, that ye “revile no more against them because of the darkness of their skins; neither shall ye revile against them because of their filthi- ness; but ye shall remember your own filthiness, and.remember. that their filthiness came because of their fathers.
10 Wherefore, ye shall remember your “children, how that ye have grieved their hearts because of the example that ye have set before them; and also, remember that ye may, because of your _ filthiness, bring your children unto destruc- tion, and their sins be heaped upon your heads at the last day.
11.O my brethren, hearken. unto my words; “arouse the faculties of your souls; shake yourselves that ye may °awake from the slumber of death ; and loose yourselves from the pains of ‘hell that ye may not become “angels to the devil, to be cast into that lake of fire and brim- stone which is the second ‘death.
12 And now I, Jacob, spake many more things unto the people of Nephi, “warning them against >fornication and ‘lasciviousness, and every kind of sin, telling them the awful consequences of them.

many of their proceedings are written upon the “larger plates, and their wars, and their contentions, and the reigns of their kings.
14 “These plates are called the plates of Jacob, and they were *’made by the hand of Nephi. And I make an end of speaking these
words. CHAPTER 4
All the prophets worshipped the Father in the name of Christ—Abraham’s offering of Isaac was in similitude of God and his Only Begotten—Men should reconcile themselves to God through the atonement—The Jews shall reject the foundation stone.
Now behold, it came to pass that I, Jacob, having ministered much unto my people in word, (and I can- not write but a “little of my words, because of the difficulty of engrav- ing our words upon. plates) and we know that the things which we write upon plates must remain;
2 But whatsoever things we write upon anything save it be upon ¢plates .must perish. and vanish away; but we can write a few words upon plates, which will give our children, and also our beloved brethren, a small degree of knowl- edge concerning us, or concerning their fathers—
3 Now in this thing we do rejoice; and we labor diligently to engraven these words upon plates, hoping that our beloved brethren and our children will receive them with thankful hearts, and look upon them that they may learn with joy and not with sorrow, neither with contempt, concerning their first “parents.

4 For, for this intent have we written these things, that they may know that we ?knew of Christ, and we had a hope of his *glory many hundred years before his coming; and not only we ourselves had a hope of his glory, but also all the holy “prophets which were before us.
5 Behold, they believed in Christ and “worshiped the Father in his name, and also we worship the Father in his *’name. And for this intent we ‘keep the “law of Moses, it “pointing our souls to him; and for this cause it is sanctified unto us. for righteousness, even as it was accounted unto Abraham in the wilderness to be obedient unto the commands of God in offering up his son Isaac, which is a ‘similitude of God and his “Only Begotten Son.
6 Wherefore, we search the proph- ets, and we have many revela- tions and the spirit-of “prophecy; and having all these "witnesses we obtain a hope, and our faith be- cometh unshaken, insomuch that we truly can ‘command in the ‘name of Jesus and the very trees obey us, or the mountains, or the waves of the sea.
7 Nevertheless, the Lord God show- eth us our “weakness that we may

know that it is by his ’grace, and his great condescensions unto the chil- dren of men, that we have power to do these things.
8 Behold, great and marvelous are the “works of the Lord. How °un- searchable are the depths of the ‘mysteries of him; and it is im- possible that man should find out all his ways. And no man “knoweth of his “ways save it be revealed unto him; wherefore, brethren, despise not the ‘revelations of God.
9 For behold, by the power of his *word "man came upon the face of the earth, which earth was ‘created by the power of his word. Wherefore, if God being able to speak and the world was, and to speak and man was created, O then, why not able to command the “earth, or the work- manship of his hands upon the-face of it, according to his will and pleasure?
10 Wherefore, brethren, seek not | to “counsel the Lord, but to take © counsel from his hand. For behold, ye yourselves know that he counsel- eth in °wisdom, and in justice, and in great mercy, over all his works.

12 And now, beloved, marvel not that I tell you these things; for why not “speak of the atonement of Christ, and attain to a perfect knowledge of him, as to attain to the knowledge of a resurrection and the world to come?
13 Behold, my brethren; he that prophesieth, let him prophesy to the understanding of men; for the “Spirit speaketh the ’truth and lieth not. Wherefore, it speaketh of things as they really ‘are, and of things as they really will be; wherefore, these things are manifested unto us “plainly, for the salvation of our souls. But behold, we are not witnesses alone in these things; for God also ‘spake them unto prophets of old. 3
14 But behold, the Jews were a “stiffnecked people; and they ’de- spised the words of ‘plainness, and 4killed the prophets, and sought for things that they could not» under- stand. Wherefore, because of their “blindness, which ‘blindness came by looking beyond the ’mark, they must needs fall; for-God hath taken away his plainness from them, and delivered unto them many things which they “cannot understand,
JACOB 4:12-18
because they desired it. And because they desired it God hath done it, that they may ‘stumble.
15 And now I, Jacob, am led on by the Spirit unto prophesying; for I perceive by the workings of the Spirit which is in me, that by the “stumbling of the °Jews they will ‘reject the 4stone upon which they might build and have safe founda- tion.
16 But -behold, according to the scriptures, this “stone shall become the great, and the last, and the only sure foundation, upon which. the Jews can build.
17 And now, my beloved, how is it possible that these, after having rejected the sure foundation, can *ever build upon it, that it may be- come the head of their corner?
18 Behold, my beloved brethren, I. will unfold this mystery unto you; if Ido not, by any means, get shaken from my firmness in the Spirit, and stumble because of my over anxiety for you.

BEHOLD, my brethren, do ye not remember to have read the words of the prophet ?Zenos, which he spake unto the house of Israel, saying:
2 Hearken, O ye house of Israel, and hear the words of me, a prophet of the Lord.
3 For behold, thus saith the Lord, I will liken thee, O house of “Israel, like unto a tame "olive-tree, which a man took and nourished in his ‘vine- yard; and it grew, and waxed old. and began to “decay.
4 And it came to pass that the master of the vineyard went forth, and he saw that his olive-tree began to decay; and he said: I will “prune it, and dig about it, and nourish it, that perhaps it may shoot forth young and tender branches, and it perish not.
5 And it came to pass that he pruned it, and digged about it, and nourished it according to his word.
6 And it came to pass that after many days it began to put forth somewhat a little, young and tender branches; but behold, the main “top thereof began to perish.
7 And it came to pass that the master of the vineyard saw it, and he said unto his “servant: It griev- eth me that I should: lose this tree; wherefore, go and pluck the branches from a wild olive-tree, and bring them hither unto me; and we will pluck off those main branches which are beginning to wither away, and we will: cast them into the fire that they may be burned.
8 And behold, saith the Lord of the vineyard, I take “away many of these young and tender branches, and I will graft them ’whithersoever I will; and it mattereth not that if it

so be that the root of this tree will perish, I may preserve the fruit thereof unto myself; wherefore, I will take these young and tender branches, and I will graft them whithersoever I will.
9 Take thou the branches of the wild olive-tree, and graft them in, in the “stead thereof; and these which I have plucked off I will cast into the fire and burn them, that they may not cumber the ground of my vineyard.
10 And-it came to pass that the servant of the Lord of the vineyard did according to the word of the Lord of the vineyard, and grafted in the branches of the “wild olive- tree.
11 And the Lord of the vineyard caused that it should be digged about, and pruned, and nourished, saying unto his servant: It griev- eth me that I should lose this tree; wherefore, that perhaps I might preserve the roots thereof that they perish not, that I might preserve them unto myself, I have done this thing:
12 Wherefore, go thy way; watch the tree, and nourish it, according to my words.
13 And these will I “place in the nethermost part of my vineyard, whithersoever I will, it mattereth not unto thee; and I doit that I may | preserve unto myself the natural |
branches of the tree; and also, that ||
I may lay up fruit thereof against the season, unto myself; for it grieveth me that I should lose this tree and the fruit thereof.

17 And it came-to pass that the Lord of the vineyard looked and beheld the tree in the which the wild olive: branches. had been grafted; and. it-had sprung forth and begun to bear “fruit. And he beheld that it was good; and the fruit thereof was like unto the natural fruit.
18 And he said unto the servant: Behold, the branches of the wild tree have taken hold of the moisture of the root thereof, that the root thereof hath brought forth much strength; and because of the much strength of the root thereof the wild branches have brought forth tame fruit. Now, if we had not grafted in these branches, the tree- thereof would have perished. And. now, behold, I shall lay up much. fruit, which the tree thereof hath brought forth; and the fruit thereof I shall lay up against the season, unto mine own self.
19 And it came to pass-that. the Lord of the vineyard said unto the servant: Come, let us go to the nethermost part of. the vineyard, and. behold if the natural. branches of. the tree have not brought forth much fruit also, that I may lay. up of..the fruit .thereof. against the season, unto mine own self.

"brought forth much fruit; and he beheld also that it was good. And he said unto the servant: Take of the fruit thereof, and lay it up against the season, that I may preserve it unto mine own self; for behold, said he, this long time have I nourished it, and it hath brought forth much fruit.
21.And. it came to pass that the servant said unto his master: How comest thou hither to plant this tree, or this branch of the tree? For behold, it was the poorest spot in all the land. of thy vineyard.
22 And the Lord of the vineyard said unto him: Counsel me not; I knew that it was.a poor spot of ground; wherefore, I said unto thee, I have nourished it this long time, and. thou. beholdest that it hath brought forth much fruit.
23. And -it came to pass that the Lord.of the vineyard said unto his servant: Look hither; behold I have planted another branch of the tree also;.and thou. knowest: that this spot of ground-was poorer than the first. But, behold the tree. I have nourished it this long time, and it hath brought forth much. fruit; therefore, gather it, and lay it up against the season, that I may pre- serve it unto mine own self.

nourished it this long time, and only a “part of the tree hath brought forth tame fruit, and the ‘other part of the tree hath brought forth wild fruit; behold, I have nourished this tree like unto the others.
26 And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard said unto the servant: Pluck off the branches that have not brought forth good “fruit, and cast them into the fire.
27 But behold, the servant said unto him: Let us prune it, and dig about it, and nourish it a little “onger, that perhaps it may bring forth good fruit unto thee, that thou canst lay it up against the season.
28 And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard and the servant of the Lord of the vineyard did nourish all the fruit of the vineyard.
29 And it came to pass that a “long time had passed away, and the Lord of the vineyard said-unto his °ser- vant: Come, let us go down into the vineyard, that we may labor again in the vineyard. For behold, the time draweth near, and the ‘end soon cometh; wherefore, I must lay up fruit against the season, unto mine own self.
30 And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard and the servant went down into the vineyard; and they came to the tree whose natural branches had been broken off, and the wild branches had been grafted in; and behold all “sorts of fruit did cumber the tree.
31 And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard did “taste of the fruit, every sort according to its number. And the Lord of the vine- yard said: Behold, this long time have we nourished this tree, and I have laid up unto myself against the season much fruit.

is "none of it which is good. And behold, there are all kinds of bad fruit; and it profiteth me nothing, notwithstanding all our labor; and now it grieveth me that I should lose this tree.
33 And the Lord of the vineyard said unto the servant: What shall we do unto the tree, that I may preserve again good fruit thereof unto mine own self?
34 And the servant said unto his master: Behold, because thou didst graft in the branches of the wild olive-tree they have nourished the roots, that they are alive and they have not perished; wherefore thou beholdest that they are yet good.
35 And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard said unto his servant: The tree profiteth me nothing, and the roots thereof profit me nothing so long as it shall bring forth evil fruit.
36 Nevertheless, I know that the roots are good, and for mine own purpose I have preserved them; and because of their much strength they have hitherto brought forth, from the wild branches, good fruit.
37 But behold, the wild branches have grown and have “overrun the roots thereof; and because that the wild branches have overcome the roots thereof it hath brought forth much evil fruit; and because that it hath brought forth so much evil fruit thou beholdest that it begin- neth to perish; and it will soon become ripened, that it may be cast into the fire, except we should do something for it to preserve it.
38 And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard said unto his servant: Let us go down into the nethermost parts of the vineyard, and behold if the natural branches have also brought forth evil fruit. 39 And it came to pass that they

went down into the nethermost parts of the vineyard. And it came to pass that they beheld that the fruit of the natural branches had become corrupt also;yea, the “first and the second and also the last; and they had:all become corrupt.
40 And the “wild fruit of the last had overcome: that part ofthe tree which brought forth good fruit, even that the branch had withered away and died.
41 And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard wept, and said unto the servant: “What could I have done more for my vineyard?
42 Behold, I knew that all the fruit of the vineyard, save it were these, had become ‘corrupted. And now these which have once brought forth good fruit have also become cor- rupted; and now all the trees of my vineyard are good for nothing save it be to be "hewn down and cast into the fire.
43 And behold this last, whose branch hath withered away, I did plant in a “good spot of ground; yea, even that which was choice unto me above all other parts of the land of my vineyard.
'44 And thou beheldest that I also cut down that which “cumbered this spot of ground, that I might plant this tree in the stead thereof.
45 And thou beheldest that a “part thereof brought forth good fruit, and a part thereof brought forth wild fruit; and because I plucked not the branches thereof and cast them into the fire, behold, they have overcome the good branch that it hath withered away.
46 And now, behold, notwithstand- ing all the care which we have taken of my’ vineyard, the trees thereof have become corrupted, that they
JACOB 5:40-50
bring forth no good “fruit; and these I had hoped to preserve, to have laid up fruit thereof against the season, unto mine own self. But, behold, they have become like unto the wild olive-tree, and they are of no worth but to be »hewn down and cast into the fire; and it grieveth me that I should lose them.
47 But “what could: 1 have done more. in my vineyard? Have I slackened mine hand, that I have not nourished. it?» Nay, I have nourished it, and I have digged about it, and I have pruned it, and I have dunged it; and I have ’stretch- ed forth mine ‘hand almost. all the day long, and. the “end draweth nigh. And it, grieveth me that I should hew down all the trees of my vineyard, and cast them into the fire that they should be burned. Who.is it that has corrupted my vineyard?
48 And it came to pass that the servant said unto his master: Is it not the “loftiness of thy vineyard— have not the branches thereof over- come the roots which are good? And because the branches have over- come the roots thereof, behold they grew faster than the strength of the roots, ?taking strength unto them- selves. Behold, I say, is not this the cause that the trees of thy vineyard have become corrupted ?
49 And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard said unto the servant: Let us go to and hew down the trees of the vineyard and cast them.into the fire, that they shall not cumber the ground of my vine- yard, for I have done all. What could I have done more for my vineyard?
50 But, behold, the servant said unto the Lord of the vineyard: Spare it a little “longer.

51 And the’ Lord’ said: Yea, I will spare it a little longer, for it grieveth me that I should lose the trees of my vineyard.
52 Wherefore, let us take of the “branches of these which I have planted in the nethermost parts of my vineyard, and let us graft them into the tree from whence they came; and let us pluck from the tree those branches whose fruit is most bitter, and graft in the natural branches of the tree in the stead thereof.
53 And this will I do that the tree may not perish, that, perhaps, I may preserve unto myself the roots thereof for mine “own purpose.
54 And, behold, the roots of the natural branches of the tree which I planted whithersoever I would are yet alive; wherefore, that I may preserve them also for mine own purpose, I will take of the “branches of this tree, and I will graft them in unto them. Yea, I will graft in unto them the branches of their mother tree, that I may preserve the roots also unto mine own self, that when they shall be ‘sufficiently strong perhaps they may bring forth good fruit unto me, and I-may yet have glory in the fruit of my vineyard.
55 And it came to pass that they took from the natural tree which had become wild, and grafted in unto the natural trees, which also had be- come wild.
56 And they also took of the natural trees which had become wild, and “grafted into their mother tree.
57 And the Lord of the vineyard said unto the servant: Pluck not the wild branches from. the trees, save it be those which are most bitter; and in them ye shall graft according to that which I have said.
58 And we will nourish again the
130
trees of the vineyard, and we will trim up the “branches thereof; and we will pluck from the trees those branches which are ripened, that must perish, and cast them into the fire.
59 And this I do that, perhaps, the roots thereof may take strength be- cause of their goodness ; and because of the change of the branches, that the good may “overcome the evil.
60 And because that I have pre- served the natural branches and the roots thereof, and that I have grafted in the natural branches again into their mother tree, and have preserved the roots of their mother tree, that, perhaps, the trees of my vineyard may bring forth again good “fruit; and that I may have joy again in the fruit of my vineyard, and, perhaps, that I may rejoice exceedingly that I have preserved the roots and the branches of the first fruit—
61 Wherefore, go to, and call “servants, that we may °labor dili- gently with our might in the vine- yard, that we may ‘prepare the way, that I may bring forth again the natural fruit, which natural fruit is good and the most precious above all other fruit.
62 Wherefore, let us go to and labor with our might this last time, for behold the end draweth nigh, and this is for the last time that I shall *prune my vineyard.
63 Graft in the branches; begin at the “Jast that they may be first, and that the first may be “last, and dig about the trees, both old and young, the first and the last; and the last and the first, that all may be nourished once again for the last time.

and prune them, and dung them once more, for the last time, for the end draweth nigh. And if it be so that these last grafts stiall grow, and bring forth the natural fruit, then shall ye prepare the way for them, that they may grow.
65 And as they begin to grow ye shall “clear away the branches which bring forth bitter fruit, according to the strength of the good and the size thereof; and ye shall not clear away the bad thereof all at once, lest the roots thereof should be too strong for the graft, and the graft thereof shall perish, and I lose the trees of my vineyard.
66 For it grieveth me that I should lose the trees of my vineyard; wherefore ye shall clear away the bad according as the good shall grow, that the root and the top may be equal in strength, until the good shall-overcome the bad, and the bad be hewn down and cast into the fire, that they cumber not the ground of my vineyard; and thus will I sweep away the bad out of my vineyard.
67 And the branches of the natural tree will I graft in again into the natural tree;
68 And the branches of the natural tree will I graft into the natural branches of the tree; and thus will I bring them together again, that they shall bring forth the natural “fruit, and they shall be one.
69 And the bad shall be “cast away, yea, even out of all the land-of my vineyard; for behold, only this once will I prune my vineyard.
70 And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard sent his “ser- vant; and the servant went and did as the Lord had commanded him, and brought other "servants; and they were ‘few.
71 And the Lord of the vineyard said unto them: Go to, and “labor in
JACOB 5:65-75
the vineyard, with your might. For behold, this is the "last time that I shall ‘nourish my vineyard; for the end is nigh at hand, and the season speedily cometh; and if ye labor with your might with me ye shall have joy in the fruit which I shall lay up unto myself against the time which will soon come.
72 And it came to-pass that the servants did go and labor with their mights; and the Lord of the vine- yard labored also with them; and they did obey the commandments of the Lord of the vineyard in all things.
73 And there began to be the natural fruit again in the vineyard; and the natural branches began to grow and thrive exceedingly; and the wild branches began to be plucked off and to be cast away; and they did Keep the root and the top thereof equal, according to the strength thereof.
74 And thus they labored, with all diligence, according to the com- mandments of the Lord of the vine- yard, even until the bad had been cast away out of the vineyard, and the Lord had preserved unto him- self that the trees had become again the natural fruit; and they became like unto “one body; and the fruits were equal; and the Lord of the vineyard had preserved unto him- self the natural fruit, which was most precious unto him from the beginning.
75 And it came to pass that when the “Lord of the vineyard saw that his fruit was good, and that his vine- yard was no more corrupt, he called up his servants, and said unto them: Behold, for this last. time have we nourished my vineyard; and thou beholdest that I have done according to my will; and I have preserved the natural fruit, that it

is good, even like as it was in the beginning. And °blessed art thou; for because ye have been diligent in laboring with me in my vineyard, and have kept my commandments, and have brought unto me again the ‘natural fruit, that my vineyard is no more corrupted, and the bad is cast away, behold ye shall have “joy with me because of the fruit of my vineyard.
76 For behold, for a “long time will I lay up of the fruit of my vine- yard unto mine own self against the season, which speedily cometh; and for the last time have I nourished my vineyard, and pruned it, and dug about it, and dunged it; where- fore I will lay up unto mine own self of the fruit, for a long time, accord- ing to that which I have spoken.
77 And when the time cometh that evil fruit shall again come into my vineyard, then will I cause the “good and the bad to be gathered; and the good will I preserve unto myself, and the bad will I cast away into its own place. And then cometh the ’season and the end; and my vine- yard will I cause to be “burned with
fire.

AND now, behold, my brethren, as I said unto you that I would prophesy, behold, this is my proph- ecy—that the things which this prophet *Zenos spake, concerning the house of Israel, in the which he likened them unto a tame Yolive- tree, must surely come to pass.
2 And the day that he shall set his hand again the second time to °re- cover his people, is the day, yea, even the last time, that the servants of the Lord shall go forth in his ‘power, to “nourish and prune his | evineyard; and after that the “end | soon cometh.
3 And how “blessed are they who have labored ’diligently in his vine- yard; and how ‘cursed are they who shall be cast out into their own place! And the ¢world shall. be ¢burned with fire.
4 And how merciful is our God unto us, for he remembereth the house of “Israel, both roots and branches; and he stretches forth his *hands unto them all the day long; and they are a ‘stiffnecked and a gainsaying people; but as many as will not harden their hearts shall be saved in the kingdom of God.

4 And he was “learned, that he had a perfect knowledge of the language of the people; wherefore, he could use much "flattery, and much power of speech, according to the ‘power of the devil.

these things; for I truly had seen bangels, and they had ministered unto me. And also, I had ‘heard the voice of the Lord speaking unto me in very word, from time to time; wherefore, I could not be shaken.
6 And it came to pass that he came unto me, and on this wise did he speak unto me, saying:. Brother Jacob, I have sought much oppor- tunity that I might speak unto you; for I have heard.and also know that thou goest about much, preaching that which ye call the “gospel, or the doctrine of Christ.
7 And ye have led away much of this people that they pervert the right way of God, and “Keep not the law of Moses which is the right way ; and convert the law of Moses into the worship of a being which ye say shall come many hundred years hence. And now behold, I, Sherem, declare unto you=that this is *blasphemy ; for no man knoweth of such things; for he cannot ‘tell of things to come. And after this manner did Sherem contend against me.
8 But behold, the Lord God poured in his “Spirit into my soul, insomuch that I did °confound him in all his words.
9 And I said: unto him: Deniest thou the Christ who shall come? And he said: If there should be a Christ, I would not deny him; but I know that there is no Christ, neither has been, nor ever will be.
10 And I said unto him: Believest thou the scriptures? And he said, Yea.
11 And I said unto him: Then ye do not understand them; for they truly testify of Christ. Behold, I say unto
134
you that none of the “prophets have written, nor "prophesied, save they have spoken concerning this Christ.
12 And this is not all—it has been made manifest unto me, for I have heard and seen; and it also has been made manifest unto me by the “power of the Holy Ghost; where- fore, I know if there should be no atonement made all mankind must be lost. :
13.And it came to pass that he said unto-me: Show me a “sign by this power of the Holy Ghost, in the which ye know so much.
14 And I said unto him: What am I that.1 should *tempt God to show unto thee a sign in the thing which thou knowest to be true? Yet thou wilt deny it, because thou art of the ‘devil. Nevertheless, not: my will be done; but if. God shall smite thee, let that be a “sign unto thee that he has power, both in heaven and in earth: and also, that Christ shall come. And thy will, O Lord, be done, and not mine.
15 And it came to pass that when I, Jacob, had spoken these words, the power of the Lord came upon him, insomuch that he fell to the earth. And it came to pass that he was nourished for the space of many days.
16 And it came to pass that he said unto the people: Gather together on the morrow, for I shall die; where- fore, I desire to speak unto the people before I shall die.
17 And it came to pass that on the morrow the multitude were gather- ed together; and he spake plainly unto them and denied. the things which he had. taught. them, and confessed the Christ, and the power

19 And he said: I “fear lest I have committed the unpardonable sin, for I have lied unto God;-for I denied the Christ, and said that I believed the scriptures; and they truly testify of him. And because I have thus lied unto God I greatly fear lest my case shall be ‘awful; but I confess unto God.
20 And it came to pass that when he had said these words he could say no more, and he “gave up the ghost.
21 And when the multitude had witnessed that he spake these things as he was about to give up the ghost, they were astonished exceedingly ; insomuch that the power of God came down upon them, and they were “overcome that they fell to the earth.
22 Now, this thing was pleasing unto me, Jacob, for I had requested it of my Father who was in heaven; for he had heard my cry and answered my prayer.

was ’vain, for they delighted in ‘wars and “bloodshed, and they had an eternal ‘hatred against us, their brethren. And they sought by the power of their arms to destroy us continually.
25 Wherefore, the people of Nephi did fortify against them with their arms, and with all their might, trusting in the God and “rock of their salvation; wherefore, they became as yet, conquerors of their enemies.
26 And it came to pass that I, Jacob, began to be old; and the record of this people being kept on the “other plates of Nephi, where- fore, I conclude this record, declar- ing that I have written according to the best of my knowledge, by saying that the time passed away with us, and also our "lives passed away like as it were unto us a ‘dream, we being a “lonesome and a solemn people, ‘wanderers, cast out from Jeru- salem, born in tribulation, in a wilderness, and hated of our breth- ren, which caused wars and con- tentions; wherefore, we did mourn out our days.
27 And I, Jacob, saw that I must soon go down to my grave; where- fore, Isaid unto my son“Enos: Take these "plates. And I told him. the things which my brother Nephi had ‘commanded me, and he promised obedience unto the commands. And I make an end of my writing upon these plates, which writing has been 4small; and to the reader I bid fare- well, hoping that many of my breth- ren may read my words. Brethren, adieu.

THE BOOK OF ENOS
Enos prays mightily and gains a re- mission of his sins—The voice of the Lord comes into his mind promising salvation for the Lamanites in a future day—Nephites sought to reclaim the Lamanites in their day—Enos rejoices in his Redeemer.
EHOLD), it came to pass that
B I, “Enos, knowing my father
that "he was a just man—for
he ‘taught me in his language, and
also in the “nurture and admonition
of the Lord—and blessed be the name of my God for it—
2 And I will tell you of the “wrestle which I had before God, before I received a "remission of my sins.
3 Behold, I went to hunt beasts in the forests; and the words which I had often heard my father speak concerning eternal life, and the “joy of the saints, "sunk deep into my | heart.
4 And my soul “hungered; and I *’kneeled down before my. Maker, and I ‘cried unto him in mighty 4prayer and supplication for mine own soul; and all the day long did I cry unto him; yea, and when the night came I did still raise my voice high that it reached the heavens.
5 And there came a “voice unto me, saying: Enos, thy sins are "forgiven thee, and thou shalt be blessed.

6 And I, Enos, knew that God could not lie; wherefore, my guilt Was swept away.
7 And I said: Lord, how is it done?
8 And he said unto me: “Because of thy ’faith in Christ, whom thou hast never before heard nor seen. And many years pass away before he shall manifest himself in the flesh; wherefore, go to, thy faith hath made thee ‘whole.
9 Now, it came to pass that when I had heard these words I began to feel a “desire for the "welfare of my brethren, the Nephites; wherefore, I did ‘pour out my whole soul unto God for them.
10 And while I was thus struggling in the spirit, behold, the voice of the Lord came into my “mind again, saying: 1 will visit thy brethren according to their diligence in keep- ing my commandments. I have >siven unto them this land, and it is a holy land; and I ‘curse it not save it be for the cause of. iniquity; wherefore, I will visit thy brethren according as I have said; and their “transgressions will I bring down with sorrow upon their own heads.
11 And after I, Enos, had heard these words, my “faith began to be ’unshaken in the Lord; and I ‘prayed unto him with many long

4strugglings for my brethren, the Lamanites.
12 And it came to pass that after I had “prayed and labored with all diligence, the Lord said unto me: I will grant unto thee according to thy desires, because of thy faith.
13 And now behold, this was the desire which I.desired of him—that if it should so be, that my. people, the Nephites, should fall into trans-
gression, and by any means be |
“destroyed, and the lLamanites should not be °destroyed, that the Lord God would ‘preserve a record of my people, the Nephites; even if it so be by the power of his holy arm, that it might be “brought forth at some future day unto the Laman- ites, that, perhaps, they might be “brought unto salvation—
14 For at the present our strug- glings. were “vain in restoring them to the true faith. And they swore in their wrath that, if it were possible, they would ’destroy our records and us, and also all the traditions of our fathers.
15 Wherefore, I knowing that the Lord God was able to “preserve our records, I cried unto him continu- ally, for he had said unto me: What- soever thing ye shall ask in faith, believing that ye shall receive in the name of Christ, ye shall receive it.
16 And I had faith, and I did cry unto God that he would “preserve the ’records; and he covenanted with me that he would ‘bring ?them forth unto the Lamanites in his own due time.
ENOS 1:12-22
17 And I, Enos, “knew it would be according to the covenant which he had made; wherefore my soul did rest.
18 And the Lord said unto me: Thy fathers have also required of me this thing; and it shall be done unto them according to their faith; for their faith was like unto thine.
19 And now it came to pass that I, Enos, went about among the people of Nephi, prophesying of things to come, and testifying of the things which I had heard and seen.
20 And I bear record that the people of Nephi did seek diligently to *restore the Lamanites unto the true faith in God. But our “labors were vain; their ‘hatred was fixed, and they were led by their evil nature that they became wild, and ferocious, and a  “blood-thirsty people, full of ‘idolatry and /filthi- ness; feeding upon beasts of prey; dwelling in ’tents, and wandering about in the wilderness with a short skin girdle about their loins and their heads shaven; and their skill was in the "bow, and in the cimeter, and the ax. And many of them did eat nothing save it was raw meat; and they were continually seeking to destroy us.
21 And it came to pass that the people of Nephi did till the land, and “raise all manner of grain, and of fruit, and "flocks of herds, and flocks of all manner of cattle of every kind, and goats, and wild goats, and also many horses.

23 And there was nothing save it was exceeding “harshness, °preach- ing and prophesying of wars, and contentions, and destructions, and continually ‘reminding them of death, and the duration of eternity, and the judgments and the power of God, and all these things—stirring them up “continually to keep them in the fear of the Lord. I say there was nothing short of these things, and exceedingly great plainness of speech, would keep them from going down speedily to destruction. And after this manner do I write concerning them.

and seventy and nine years had passed away from the time that our father Lehi “left Jerusalem.
26 And I saw that I *must soon go down to my grave, having been wrought upon by the power of God that I must preach and prophesy unto this people, and declare the word according to the truth which is in Christ. And I have declared it in all my days, and have rejoiced in it above that of the world.
27 And I soon go to the place of my “rest, which is with my Re- deemer; for I Know that in him I shall "rest.

and as these things are ‘written for the intent of the benefit of our brethren the 7Lamanites, wherefore, it must needs be that I write a little; but I shall not write the things of my prophesying, nor of my revelations.

4 And there are many among us who have many “revelations, for they are not all °stiffmecked. And as many as are not stiffnecked and have faith, have ‘communion with the Holy Spirit, which maketh manifest unto the children of men, according to their faith.
5 And now, behold, *two hundred years had passed away, and the people of Nephi had waxed strong in the land. They observed to “Keep the law of Moses and the ’sabbath day holy unto the Lord. And they ‘profaned not; neither did they “blaspheme. And the “laws of the land were exceedingly strict.
6 And ‘they were scattered upon "much of the face of the land, and the Lamanites also. And they were exceedingly more ’numerous than were they of the Nephites; and they loved ‘murder and would drink the “blood of beasts.
7 And it came to’ pass that they came many. times against us, the Nephites, to battle. But our “kings and-our “leaders were mighty men in the faith of the Lord; and they taught the people the ways of the Lord; wherefore, we withstood the Lamanites and swept them away out

of ‘our lands, and began to fortify our cities, or whatsoever place of our inheritance.
8 And we multiplied exceedingly, and spread upon the face of the land, and became exceedingly rich in “gold, and in silver, and in precious things, and in fine "workmanship of wood, in buildings, and in ‘machin- ery, and also in iron and copper, and brass and steel, making all manner of tools of every kind to till the ground, and 4¢weapons of war—yea, the sharp pointed arrow, and the quiver, and the dart, and the javelin, and all preparations for war.
9 And thus being prepared to meet the Lamanites, they did not pros- per against us. But the word of the Lord was verified, which he spake unto our fathers, saying that: “In- asmuch as ye will keep my com- mandments ye shall ’prosper in the land.
10 And it came to pass that the prophets of the Lord did threaten the people of Nephi, according to the word of God, that if they did not keep the commandments, but should fall into transgression, they should be “destroyed from off the face of the land.
11 Wherefore, the prophets, and the priests, and the “teachers, did labor diligently, exhorting with all long-suffering the people to °dili- gence}; teaching the ‘law of Moses, and the intent for which it was given; persuading them to “look for- ward unto the Messiah, and believe in him to come “as though he already

12 And it came to pass that by so doing they kept them from being destroyed upon the face of the land; for they did prick their hearts with the word, ‘continually stirring them up unto repentance.

14And I, Jarom, donot write more, for the plates are “small. But behold, my brethren, ye can go to the other plates of Nephi; for behold, upon them the records of our wars are engraven, according to the writings of the ‘kings, or those which they caused to be written.
15 And I deliver these plates into the hands of my son Omni, that they may be kept according to the “com- mandments of my fathers.

7 Wherefore, the Lord did visit them in great judgment; neverthe- less, he did spare the righteous that they should not perish, but did deliver them out of the hands of their enemies.
8 And it came to pass that I did deliver the plates unto my brother Chemish.
9 Now I, Chemish, write what few things I write, in the same book with my brother; for behold, I saw the last which he wrote, that he wrote it with his own hand; and he wrote it in the day that he delivered them unto me. And after this manner we keep the “records, for it is accord- ing to the commandments of our fathers. And I make an end.
10 Behold, I, Abinadom, am the son: of Chemish. Behold, it came to pass that I saw much war and contention between my people, the Nephites, and the Lamanites; and I, with my own sword, have taken the lives of many of the Lamanites in the defence of my brethren.

he should. “flee out of the ‘land of ‘Nephi, and as-many as would hearken unto the voice of the Lord should also ’depart out of the land with him, into the wilderness—
13 And it came to pass that he did according as the Lord had com- manded him. And they departed out of the land into the wilderness, as many, as would hearken-unto the voice of the Lord ; and they were led by many: preachings and prophesy- ings. And they were admonished continually by the word of God; and they were led by the power of his arm, through the wilderness. un- til they came down-into the land which. is called the "land of Zara- hemla.
14 And-they discovered a “people, who were called -the people of Zarahemla. Now, there was great rejoicing among. the people of Zarahemla; and also Zarahemla did rejoice exceedingly, because the Lord had sent the people of Mosiah with the "plates of brass which contained the record of the Jews.
15 Behold, it came to pass that Mosiah discovered that the people of ¢“Zarahemla came out from Jeru- salem at the time that ’Zedekiah, king of Judah, was carried away captive into Babylon.
16 And they “journeyed in the wilderness, and were brought. by. the hand of the Lord across the great waters, into the land where Mosiah discovered them; and they had dwelt there from that time forth.
17 And at the time that Mosiah discovered them, they had become exceedingly numerous. Neverthe- less, they had had many wars and serious contentions, and had fallen by the sword from time to time; and

their “language had become corrupt- ed; and they had brought no ’re- cords with them; and they denied the being of their Creator; and Mosiah, nor the people of Mosiah, could understand them.
18 But it came to pass that Mosiah caused that they should be taught in his 7anguage. And it came to pass that after they were taught in the language of Mosiah, Zarahemla gave a genealogy of his fathers, according to his memory ; and they are written, but °not in these plates.
19 And it came to pass that the people of Zarahemla, and of Mosiah, did “unite together; and "Mosiah was appointed to be their king.
20 And it came to pass in the days of Mosiah, there was a large “stone brought unto him with engravings on it; and he did “interpret the engravings by the gift and power of God.
21 And they gave an account of one “Coriantumr, and the slain of his people. And Coriantumr was dis- covered by the people of Zarahemla ; and he dwelt with them for the space of nine moons.
22 It also spake a few words con- cerning his fathers. And his first parents came out from the “tower, at the time the Lord ’confounded the language of the people; and the severity of the Lord fell upon them according to his judgments, which are just; and their “bones lay scat- tered in the land northward.
23 Behold, I, Amaleki, was born in the days of Mosiah; and I have lived to see his death; and “Benjamin, "his son, reigneth in his stead.

24 And behold, I have seen, in the days of king Benjamin, a serious war and much bloodshed between the Nephites and the Lamanites. But behold, the Nephites did obtain much advantage over them; yea, insomuch that king Benjamin did drive them out of the land of Zara- hemla.
25 And it came to pass that I began to be old; and, having no seed, and knowing king “Benjamin to be a just man before the Lord, wherefore, I shall deliver up ‘these plates unto him, exhorting all men to come un- to God, the Holy One of. Israel, and believe in prophesying, and in revelations, and in the ministering of angels, and in the gift of speak- ing with tongues, and in the gift of interpreting languages, and in all things which are “good; for there is nothing which is good save it comes from the Lord: and that which is evil cometh from the devil.
26 And now, my beloved brethren, I would that ye should “come unto Christ, who is the Holy One of Israel, and partake of his salvation, and the power of his redemption. Yea, come unto him, and “offer your whole souls as an ‘offering unto him, and continue in “fasting and pray- ing, and endure to the end; and as the Lord liveth ye will be saved.

13 And it came to pass also that the armies of the Lamanites came down out of the “land of Nephi, to battle against his people. But behold, king Benjamin gathered together his armies, and he did stand against them; and he did fight with the strength of his own arm, with the *sword of Laban.
14 And in the “strength of the Lord they did contend against their enemies, until they had slain many thousands of the Lamanites. And it came to pass that they did contend against the Lamanites until they had driven them out of all the lands of their inheritance.
15 And it came to pass that after there had been false “Christs, and their mouths had been shut, and they punished according to their crimes;

CHAPTER 1
King Benjamin teaches his sons the language and prophecies of their fathers—Their religion and civiliza- tion have been preserved because of the records kept on the various plates— Mosiah is chosen as king and is given custody of the records and other things.
ND now there was no more A contention in all the “land of Zarahemla, among all the people who belonged to king Benja- min, so that king Benjamin had continual peace all the remainder of his days.
2 And it came to pass that he had three “sons; and he called their names Mosiah, and Helorum, and Helaman. And he caused that they should be ’taught in all the ‘language of his fathers, that thereby they might become men of understand- ing; and that they might know concerning the prophecies -which had been spoken by the mouths of their fathers, which were delivered them by the hand of the Lord.

6Omy sons, I would that ye should remember that these sayings are true, and also that these records are “true. And behold, also the plates of Nephi, which contain the records and the sayings of our fathers from the time they left Jerusalem until now, and they are true; and we can know of their surety because we have them before our eyes.
7 And now, my sons, I would that ye should remember to “search them diligently, that ye may profit there- by; and I would that ye should ’keep the commandments of God, that ye may ‘prosper in the land accord- ing to the “promises which the Lord made unto our fathers.
8 And many more things did king Benjamin teach his sons, which are not written in this book.
9 And it came to pass that after king Benjamin had made an end of teaching his sons, that he waxed "old, and he saw that he must very soon go the way of all the earth; therefore, he thought it expedient that he should confer the kingdom upon one of his sons.
10. Therefore, *he had Mosiah brought before him; and these are the words which he spake unto him, saying: My son, I would that ye should make a proclamation throughout all this land among all

this “people, or the people of Zara- hemla, and the people of Mosiah who dwell in the land, that thereby they may be gathered together; for on the morrow I shall proclaim unto | this my people out of mine own | mouth that thou art a *king and a ruler over this people, whom the Lord our God hath given us.

people a “name, that thereby they | may be distinguished above all the people which the Lord God hath brought out of the land of Jeru- salem; and this I do because they | have been a ’diligent people in keep- ing the commandments of the Lord.
12 And I give unto them a name that never shall be blotted out, except it be through “transgression.
13 Yea, and moreover I say un- to you, that if this highly favored people of the Lord should fall into “transgression, and become a wicked and an adulterous people, that the Lord will deliver them up, that thereby they become °weak like unto their brethren; and he will no
more ‘preserve them by his match- |

14 For I say unto you, that if he had not extended his arm in the preservation of our fathers they must have fallen into the hands of the Lamanites, and become victims to their hatred.
15 And it came to pass that after king Benjamin had made an end of these sayings to his son, that he gave him “charge concerning all the affairs of the kingdom.

17 Therefore, as they were “un- faithful they did not prosper nor progress in their journey, but were ’driven back, and incurred the dis- pleasure of God upon them; and therefore they were smitten with famine and sore ‘afflictions, to stir them up in ¢remembrance of their duty.
18 And now, it came to pass that Mosiah went and did as his father had commanded him, and pro- claimed unto all the people who were in the land of Zarahemla that there- by they might gather themselves together, to go up to the “temple to hear the words which his father should speak unto them.

2 And there were a great number, even sO many that they did not number them; for they had multi- plied exceedingly and waxed great in the land.
3 And they also took of the “first- lings of their flocks, that they might offer ’sacrifice and ‘burnt “offerings “according to the law of Moses;

5 And it came to pass that when they came up to the temple, they pitched their tents round about, every man according to his “family, consisting of his wife, and his sons, and his daughters, and their sons, and their daughters, from the eldest down to the youngest, every family being separate one from another.
6 And they pitched their tents round about the temple, every man having his “tent with the door there- of towards the temple, that thereby they might remain in their tents and hear the words which king Benjamin should speak unto them;

7 For the multitude being so great that king Benjamin could not teach them all within the walls of the temple, therefore he caused a “tower to be erected, that thereby his people might hear the words which he should speak unto them.
8 And it came to pass that he began to speak to his people from the tower; and they could not all hear his words because of the great- ness of the multitude; therefore he caused that the words which he spake should be written and sent forth among those that were not under the sound of his voice, that they might also receive his words.
9 And these are the words which he “spake and caused to be written, saying: My brethren, all ye that have assembled yourselves together, you that can hear my words which I shall speak unto you this day; for I have not commanded you to come up hither to “trifle with the words which I shall speak, but that you should ‘hearken unto me, and open yourears that ye may hear, and your “hearts that ye may understand, and your ’minds that the mysteries of God may be unfolded to your view.
10 I have not commanded you to come up hither that ye should fear “me, or that ye should think that I of myself am more than a mortal man.
11 But I am like as yourselves, subject to all manner of infirmities in body and mind; yet I have been chosen by this people, and “conse- crated by *my father, and was suf- fered by the hand of the Lord that I should be a ruler and a king over this people; and have been kept and preserved by his matchless power,

to serve you with all the might, mind and strength which the Lord hath granted unto me.
12 I say unto you that as I have been suffered to “spend my days in your service, even up to this time, and have not sought gold nor silver nor any manner of riches of you;
13 Neither have I suffered that ye should be confined in dungeons, nor that ye should make slaves one of another, nor that ye should murder, or plunder, or steal, or commit adult- ery; nor even have I suffered that ye should commit any manner of wickedness, and have taught you that ye should keep the command- ments of the Lord, in all things which he hath commanded you—

19 And behold also, if 1, whom ye call your king, who has spent his days in your servicé, and yet has been in the service of God, do merit any thanks from you, O how you ought to “thank your heavenly >King!
20.1 say unto you, my brethren, that if you should render all the *thanks and °praise which your whole soul has power to possess, to that God who has created you, and has kept and ‘preserved you; and has caused that ye should “rejoice, and has granted that ye should live in peace one with another—
21 Tsay unto you that if ye should “serve him who has created you from the beginning, and is ’preserv- ing you from day to day, by lending you ‘breath, that-ye may live and move and do according to your own 4will, and even supporting you from one moment to another—lI say, if ye should serve him with all your ‘whole souls yet ye would. be ‘un- profitable servants.
22 And behold, all that he “requires of you is to "keep his command- ments; and he has ‘promised you that if ye would keep his command- ments ye should prosper in the land; and he never doth ¢vary from that which he hath said; therefore, if
MOSIAH 2:18-28
ye do *keep his ‘commandments he doth bless you and prosper you.
23 And now, in the first place, he hath created you, and granted unto you your lives, for which ye are indebted unto him.
24 And secondly, he doth “require that ye should do as he hath com- manded. you; for which if ye do, he doth immediately "bless you; and therefore he hath paid you. And ye are still indebted unto him, and are, and will be, forever and ever; there- fore, of what have ye to boast?
25 And now I ask, can ye say aught of yourselves? I answer you, Nay. Ye cannot say that ye are even as much as the dust of the earth; yet ye were “created of the °dust of the earth; but behold, it “‘beiongeth tohim who created you.
26 And I, even I, whom ye call your king, am “no better than ye yourselves are; for I am also of the dust. And ye behold that I am old, and am about to yield up this mortal frame to its mother earth.
27 Therefore,.as I said unto you that I had “served you, °walking with a clear conscience before God, even so I at this time have caused that ye should assemble yourselves together, that I might be found blameless, and that your ‘blood should not come upon me, when I shall stand to be judged of God of the things whereof he hath commanded me concerning you.

“rid my garments of your blood, at this period of time when I am about to godowntomy grave, that I might go down in peace, and my immortal *spirit may join the ‘choirs above in singing the praises of a just God.
29 And moreover, I say unto you that I have caused that ye should assemble yourselves together, that I might declare unto you that I can no longer be your teacher, nor your king;
30 For even at this time, my whole frame doth tremble exceedingly while attempting to speak unto you; but the Lord God doth support me, and hath suffered me that I should speak unto you, and hath com- manded me that I. should declare unto you this day, that my son Mosiahis a*king and aruler over you.
31 And now, my brethren, I would that ye should do as ye have hither- to done. As ye have.kept my com- mandments, and also the com- mandments of my father, and have prospered, and have been kept from falling into the hands of your enemies, even so if ye shall keep the commandments of my son, or the commandments of God which shall be delivered unto you by him, ye shall prosper in the land, and your enemies shall have no power over you.
32 But, O my people, beware lest there shall arise “contentions among you, and ye °list to ‘obey the evil spirit, which was spoken of by my father Mosiah.
33 For behold, there is a wo pro- nounced upon him who listeth to *obey that spirit; for if he listeth to
150 obey him, and remaineth and dieth in his °sins, the same drinketh ‘damnation to his own soul; for he receiveth for his wages an “ever- lasting “punishment, having trans- gressed the law of God contrary to” his own knowledge.
34 I say unto you, that there are not any among you, except it be your little children that have not been taught concerning these things, but what knoweth that ye are eternally “indebted to your heavenly Father, to render to him “all that you have and-are; and also have been taught concerning the ‘records which contain the prophecies which have been spoken by the holy proph- ets, even down to the time our father, Lehi, left Jerusalem;
35 And also, all that has been spoken by our fathers until now. And behold, also, they spake that which was commanded them of the Lord; therefore, they are “just and true.
36 And now, I say unto you, my brethren, that after ye have known and have been taught all these things, if ye should transgress and go ‘contrary to that which has been spoken, that ye do ’withdraw your- selves from the Spirit of the Lord, that it may have no place in you to guide you in wisdom’s paths that ye may be blessed, prospered, and preserved—
37 I say unto you, that the man _ that doeth this, the same cometh out in open “rebellion against God; therefore he “listeth to obey the evil spirit, and becometh an enemy to all righteousness; therefore, the Lord

38 Therefore if that man “repenteth not, and remaineth ‘and dieth an enemy to God, the demands of divine °justice do awaken his im- mortal soul to a lively sense of his own ‘guilt, which doth cause him to shrink from the “presence of the Lord, and doth fill his breast with guilt, and “pain, and /anguish, which is like an unquenchable ‘fire, whose flame ascendeth up forever and ever.
39 And now I say unto you, that “mercy hath no claim on that man; therefore his final doom is to endure anever-ending ’torment.
40 O, all ye “old men, and also ye young men, and you little children who can understand my words, for Thave spoken plainly unto you that ye might understand, I pray that ye should awake to a "remembrance of the awful situation of those that have fallen into transgression.
41 And moreover, I would desire that. ye should consider on the blessed and “happy state of those that keep the commandments of God. For behold, they are °blessed in all things, both temporal and spiritual; and if «they hold out ‘faithful to the end they are received into “heaven, that thereby they may dwell with God in a state of never- ending happiness. O remember, remember that. these things are true; for the Lord God hath spoken its

CHAPTER 3
King Benjamin continues his ad- dress—The Lord Omnipotent. shall minister among men in a tabernacle of clay—Blood shall come from every pore as_he atones for the sins of the world—His is the only name whereby salvation comes—Men can. put off the natural man and become saints through the atonement—The. torment of the wicked shall be as a lake of fire and brimstone.
AND again my brethren, I would call your attention, for Ihave some- what more’to speak unto you; for behold, I have things to tell you concerning that which is to come.
2 And the things which I shall tell you. are made known unto me by an “angel from God. And he said unto me: “Awake; and I awoke, and be- hold he stood before me.
3 And he said unto me: Awake, and hear the words which I shall tell thee; for behold, I am come to declare unto you the “glad tidings of great joy.
4 For the Lord hath heard thy prayers, and hath judged ‘of thy “righteousness, and hath sent me to declare unto thee that thou mayest rejoice; and that thou mayest de- clare unto thy people, that they may also be filled with joy.
5 For behold, the time cometh, and is not far distant, that with power, the “Lord "Omnipotent who ‘reigneth, who was, and is from all “eternity to all eternity, shall come down from heaven among. the

6 And he shall cast out “devils, or the "evil spirits which dwell in the hearts of the children of men.
7 And lo, he shall “suffer °tempta- tions, and pain of body, “hunger, thirst, and fatigue, even more than man can “suffer, except it be unto death; for behold, “blood cometh from every pore, so great shall be his ‘anguish for the wickedness and the abominations of his people.
8 And he shall be called *Jesus ’Christ, the ‘Son of God, the “Father of heaven and earth, the *Creator of all things from the beginning; and his ‘mother shall be called Mary.
9 And lo, he cometh unto his own, that ‘salvation might come unto the children of men even through °faith on his name; and even after all this they shall consider him a man, and say that he hath a ‘devil, and shall

10 And he shall “rise the °third day from the dead; and behold, he standeth to ‘judge the world; and behold, all these things are done that a righteous judgment might come upon the children of men.
11 For behold, and also his *blood batoneth for the sins of those who have ‘fallen by the transgression of Adam, who have died not knowing the ¢will.of God concerning them, or who have “ignorantly sinned.
12 But wo, wo unto him who knoweth that he “rebelleth against God! For salvation cometh to none suchexceptit bethrough repentance and faith on the °Lord Jesus Christ.
13 And the Lord God hath sent his holy “prophets among all the chil- dren of men, to declare these things to every kindred, nation, and tongue, that thereby whosoever should believe that Christ should come, the same might receive °re- mission of their sins, and rejoice with exceedingly great joy, even ‘as though he had already come among them.

14 Yet the Lord God saw that his people were a “stiffnecked people, and he appointed unto them a “law, even the ‘law of Moses.
15 And many signs, and wonders, and “types, and shadows showed he unto them, concerning his coming; and also holy prophets spake unto them concerning his coming; and yet they "hardened their hearts, and understood not that the ‘law of Moses availeth nothing “except it were through the “atonement of his blood.
16 And even if it were possible that little *children could sin they could not be saved; but I say unto you they are blessed; for behold, as in Adam, or by nature, they fall, even so the blood of Christ ‘atoneth for their sins.

are they found no more blameless in the sight of God; only according to the words which I have spoken unto thee.
23 And now I have spoken the words which the Lord God hath commanded me.
24 And thus saith the Lord: They shall stand as a bright testimony against this people, at the judgment day; whereof they shall be judged, every man according to his works, whether they be good, or whether they be evil.
25 And if they be evil they are consigned to an awful “view of their own guilt and abominations, which doth cause them to shrink from the presence of the Lord into a state of misery and ‘endless torment, from whence they can no more return; therefore they have drunk damna- tion to their own souls.
26 Therefore, they have drunk out of the “cup of the wrath of God, which justice could no more deny unto them than it could deny that *’Adam should fall because of his partaking of the forbidden ‘fruit; therefore, “mercy could have claim on them no more forever.
27 And their “torment is as a "lake of fire and brimstone, whose flames are unquenchable, and whose smoke ascendeth up ‘forever and ever. Thus hath the Lord commanded me. Amen.

AND now, it came to pass that when king Benjamin had made an end of speaking the words which had been delivered unto him by the 2angel of the Lord, that he cast his eyes round about on the multitude, and behold they had "fallen to the earth, for the ‘fear of the Lord had come upon them.
2 And they had “viewed themselves in their own °’carnal state, even ‘less than the dust of the earth. And they all cried aloud with one voice, say- ing: O have mercy, and apply the 4atoning blood of Christ that wemay receive forgiveness of our sins, and our hearts may be “purified; for we believe in Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who ‘created heaven and earth, and all things; who shall come down among the children of men.
3 And it came to pass that after they had spoken these words the Spirit of the Lord came upon them, and they were filled with joy, having received a “remission of their sins, and having peace of °conscience, because of the exceeding ‘faith which they had in Jesus Christ who should come, according to the 4words which king Benjamin had spoken unto them.
4 And king Benjamin again opened his mouth and began to speak un- to them, saying: My friends and my brethren, my kindred and my people, I would again call your attention, that ye may hear and

understand. the remainder of my words which I shall speak unto you.
5 For behold,. if the knowledge of the goodness of God at this time has awakened you to a sense of your ‘nothingness, and your worthless and fallen state—
6 I say unto you, if ye have come to a “knowledge of the goodness of God, and his matchless power, and his wisdom, and his patience, and his long-suffering towards the children of men; and also, the ’atonement which has been prepared from the ‘foundation of the world, that there- by salvation might come to him that should put his ¢trust in the Lord, and should be diligent in keeping his commandments, and continue in the faith even unto the end of his life, I mean the life of the mortal body—
7 I say, that this is the man. who receiveth salvation, through the atonement which was prepared from the foundation of the world for all mankind, which ever were since the *fall of Adam, or._who are, or who ever shall be, even unto the end of the world.
8 And this is the means where- by salvation cometh. And. there is ‘none other salvation :save this which hath been spoken of; neither are there any conditions whereby man_can be saved except the condi- tions which I have told you.

believe that man doth not ¢compre- hend all the things which the Lord can comprehend.
10 And again, believe that ye must ‘repent of your sins and forsake them, and humble yourselves before God; and ask in “sincerity of heart that he would ‘forgive you; and now, if you “believe all: these things see that ye‘do them.
11 And again I say unto you as I have said before, that as ye have come to the knowledge of the glory of God, or if ye have known of his goodness and have “tasted of his love, and have received a "remission of your sins, which causeth such exceedingly great joy in your souls, even so I would that ye should remember, and always retain in re- membrance, the greatness of God, and your own ‘nothingness, and his 4goodness and long-suffering to- wards you, unworthy creatures, and humble yourselves even in the depths of “humility, ‘calling on the name of the Lord daily, and stand- ing ’steadfastly in the faith of that which is to come, which was spoken by the mouth of the angel.
12 And behold, I say unto you that if ye do this ye shall always rejoice, and be filled with the “love of God, and always “retain a remission of your sins; and ye shall grow in the ‘knowledge of the glory of him that created you, or in the knowledge of that which is just and true.

14 And ye will not suffer your *children that they go hungry, or naked; neither will ye °suffer that they transgress the laws of God, and fight and ‘quarrel one with another, and serve the devil, who is the master of sin, or who is the “evil spirit which hath been spoken of by our fathers, he being an enemy to all righteousness.
15 But ye will “teach them to walk in the ways of truth and ‘soberness ; ye will teach them to “love one another, and to serve one another.
16 And also, ye yourselves will *succor those that stand in need of your succor; ye will administer of your substance unto him that stand- eth in need; and ye will not suffer that the "beggar putteth up his peti- tion to you in vain,.and turn him out to perish.
17 Perhaps thou shalt “say: The man has brought upon himself his misery; therefore I will stay my hand, and will not give unto him of my food, nor impart unto him of my substance that he may not suffer, for his punishments are just—
18 But Isay unto you, Oman, who- soever doeth this the same hath great cause to repent; and except he repenteth of that which he hath done he _ perisheth forever, and hath no interest in the kingdom of God.

for silver, and for all the riches which we have of every kind?
20 And behold, even at this time, ye have been calling on his name, and begging for a “remission of your sins. And has he suffered that ye have begged in vain? Nay; he has poured out his °Spirit upon you, and has caused that your hearts should be filled with ‘joy, and has caused that your mouths should be stopped that ye could not find utterance, so exceedingly great was your joy.
21 And now, if God, who has created you, on whom you are de- pendent for your lives and for all that ye have and are, doth grant unto you whatsoever ye ask that is right, in faith, believing that. ye shall receive, O then, how ye ought to “impart of the substance that ye have one to another.
22 And if ye “judge the man who putteth up his petition to you for your substance that he perish not, and condemn him, how much more just will be your °condemnation for withholding your substance, which doth not belong to you but to God, to whom also your life “‘belongeth; and yet ye put up no petition, nor repent of the thing which thou hast done.
23 I say unto you, wo be unto that man, for his substance shall perish with him; and now, I say these things unto those who are “rich as pertaining to the things of this world.
24 And again, I say unto the poor, ye who have not and yet have sufficient, that ye remain from day to day; I mean all you who deny

the beggar, because ye have not; I would that ye say in your hearts that: 1 “give not because I "have not, but if [had I would ‘give.
25 And now, if ye say this in your hearts ye remain guiltless, otherwise ye are “condemned; and your con- demnation is just for ye covet that which ye have not received.
26 And now, for the sake of these things which I have spoken unto you—that is, for the sake of retain- ing a remission of your sins from day to day, that ye may “walk guiltless before God—I would that ye should *impart of your substance to the ‘poor, every man according to that which he hath, such as “feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, visiting the sick and administering to their relief, both spiritually and temporally, according to their wants.
27 And see that all these things are done in wisdom and “order; for it is not requisite that a man should run ‘faster than he has strength. And again, it is expedient that he should be diligent, that thereby he might win the prize; therefore, all things must be done in order.
28 And I would that ye should remember, that whosoever among you “borroweth of his neighbor should return the thing that he borroweth, according as he doth agree, or else thou shalt commit sin; and perhaps thou shalt cause thy neighbor to commit sin also.
29 And finally, I cannot tell you all the things whereby ye may commit sin; for there are divers ways and means, even so many that I cannot number them.

And now, O man, remember, and perish not:

The saints become the sons and daughters of Christ through faith— They are then called by the name of Christ—King Benjamin exhorts them to be steadfast and immovable in good works.
AND now, it came to pass that when king Benjamin had thus spo- ken to his people, he sent among them, desiring to know of his people if they “believed the words which he had spoken unto them.
2 And they all cried with one voice, saying: Yea, we believe all the words which thou hast spoken unto us; and also, we know of their surety and truth, because of the Spirit of the Lord Omnipotent, which has wrought a mighty “change in us, or in our hearts, that we have no more disposition to do “evil, but to do good continually.
3 And we, ourselves, also, through the infinite “goodness of God, and the manifestations of his Spirit, have great views of that which is to come; and were it expedient, we could prophesy of all things.
4 And it is the faith which we have had on the things which our king has spoken unto us that has brought

us to this great knowledge, whereby we do rejoice with such exceedingly great joy. ;
5 And we are willing to enter intoa "covenant with our God to do his will, and to be obedient to his com- mandments in all things that he shall command us, all the remainder of our days, that we may not bring upon ourselves a "never-ending tor- ment, as has been spoken by the ‘angel, that we may not drink out of the cup of the wrath of God.
6 And now, these are the words which king Benjamin desired of them; and therefore he said unto them: Ye have spoken the words that I desired; and the covenant which ye have made is a righteous covenant.
7 And now, because of the cove- nant which ye have made ye shall be called the “children of Christ, his sons, and his daughters; for behold, this day he hath spiritually begotten you; for ye say that your hearts are ’changed through faith on his name; therefore, ye are ‘born of him and have become his “sons and _ his daughters.
8 And under this head ye are made °free, and there is °no other head whereby ye can be made free. There is no other ‘name given whereby salvation cometh; therefore, I would that ye should take upon you the name of Christ, all you that have entered into the covenant with God that ye should be obedient unto the end of your lives.
9 And it shall come to pass that whosoever doeth this shall be found at the right hand of: God, for he
158 |
shall know the name by which he is called; for he shall be called by the © name of Christ.
10 And now it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall not take upon him the name of Christ must be called by some “other name; there- fore, he findeth himself on the "left hand of God.
11 And I would that ye should remember also, that this is the *name that I said I should give unto you that never should be blotted out, except it be through transgres- sion; therefore, take heed that ye do | not transgress, that the name be not blotted out of your hearts.
12, 1 say unto you, I would that ye should remember to “retain the name written always in your hearts, that ye are not found on the left hand of God, but that ye hear and know the voice by which ye shall be called, and also, the name by which he shall call you.
13 For how *knoweth a man the | master whom he has not served, and who is a stranger unto him, and is far from the thoughts and intents of his heart?
14 And again, doth a man take an ass which belongeth to his neighbor, and keep him? I say unto you, Nay; | he will not even suffer that he shall } feed among his flocks, but will drive | him away, and cast him out. I say unto you, that even so shall it be || among you if ye know not the name | by which ye are called.
15 Therefore, I would that ye should be steadfast and immovable, always abounding in “good works, that Christ, the Lord God Omnipo-

CHAPTER 6
King Benjamin records the names of the people andappoints priests to teach them—Mosiah reigns as a righteous king.
AND now, king Benjamin thought it was expedient, after having finished speaking to the people, that he should “take the names of all those who had entered into a cove- nant with God to keep his com- mandments.
2 And it came to pass that ‘there was not one soul, except it were little children, but'who had entered into the covenant and had taken upon them the name of Christ.
3 And again, it came to pass that when king Benjamin had made an end of all these things, and had consecrated his son “Mosiah to be a ruler anda king over his people, and had given him all the charges con- cerning the kingdom, and also had ‘appointed “priests to “teach the people, that thereby they might hear and know the commandments of God, and to stir them up in re- membrance of the ‘oath which they had made, he dismissed the multi- tude, and they returned, every one, according to their ‘families, to their own houses.

from the “time that Lehi left Jeru- salem.
5 And king Benjamin lived three yearst and he died.
6 And it came to pass that king Mosiah did “walk in the ways of the Lord, and did observe his judgments and his statutes, and did keep his commandments in all things what- soever he commanded him.
7 And king Mosiah did cause his people that they should till the earth. And he also, himself, did till the earth, that thereby he might “not become burdensome to his people, that he might do according to that which his father had done in all things. And there was no con- tention among all his people for the space of three years.
CHAPTER
Ammon finds the land of Lehi-Nephi where Limhi is king—Limhi’s people are in bondage to the Lamanites— Limhi_ recounts their history—A prophet (Abinadi) had testified that Christ is the God and Father of all things—Those who sow filthiness reap the whirlwind, and those who put their trust in the Lord shall be delivered.
AND now, it came to pass that after king Mosiah had had continual peace for the space of three years, he was desirous to know concerning the people who “went up to dwell in the land of °Lehi-Nephi, or in the city of Lehi-Nephi; for his people had heard nothing from them from the time they left the land of °Zara- hemla; therefore, they wearied him with their teasings.
2 And it came to pass that tking Mosiah granted that sixteen of their strong men might go up to the land of Lehi-Nephi, to inquire concerning their brethren.

3 And it came to pass that on the morrow they started to go up, hav- ing with them one*Ammon, he being a strong and mighty man, and a *descendant of Zarahemla; and he was also their leader.
4 And now, they knew not the course they should travel in the wilderness to go up to the land of Lehi-Nephi; therefore they wan- dered many days in the wilderness, even “forty days did they wander.
5 And when they had wandered forty days they came to a “hill, which is north of the land of *Shilom, and there they pitched their tents.
6 And ?Ammon took three of his brethren, and their. names were Amaleki, Helem, and Hem, and they went down into the land of >’Nephi.
7 And behold, they met the king of the people who were in the land of Nephi, and in the land of *Shilom; and they were surrounded by the king’s guard, and were "taken, and were ‘bound, and were committed to “prison.
8 And it came to pass when they had been in prison two days they were again brought before the king, and their bands were loosed; and they stood before the king, and were permitted, or rather “commanded, that they should answer the ques- tions which he should ask them.
9 And he said unto them: Behold, I am *Limhi, the son of Noah, who was the son of Zeniff, who came up out of the "land of Zarahemla to inherit this land, which was the land of their fathers, who was made a ‘king by the ¢voice of the people.

10 And now, “I desire to know the cause whereby ye were so bold-as to come near the walls of the city, when I, myself, was with my guards without the "gate?
11 And now, for this cause have I suffered that ye should be preserved, that I might inquire of you, or else I should have caused that my guards should have put you to death. Ye are permitted to speak.
12 And now, when Ammon saw that he was permitted to speak, he went forth and “bowed himself before the king; and rising again he said: O king, I am very thankful before God this day that I am yet alive, and am permitted to speak; and I will endeavor to speak with boldness ;
13 For I am assured that.if ye had known me ye would not have suffer- ed that I should have worn these bands. For I am Ammon, and am a “descendant of Zarahemla, and have come up out of the “land of Zarahemla to inquire concerning our brethren, whom °Zeniff brought up out of that land.
14 And now, it came to pass that after Limhi had heard the words of Ammon, he was exceedingly “glad, and said: Now, I know of a surety that my brethren who were in the land of Zarahemla are °yet alive. And now, I will rejoice; and on the morrow I will cause that my people shall rejoice also.
15 For behold, we are in bondage to the Lamanites, and are “taxed with a tax which is grievous to be borne. And now, behold, our breth- ren will deliver us out of our °bond- age, or out of the hands of the

Lamanites, and «we will be their ‘slaves; for it is better that we be slaves to the Nephites than to pay tribute to the king of the Lamanites.
16 And now, king Limhi com- manded his guards that they should no more bind Ammon nor his breth- ren, but caused that they should go to the hill. which was north of Shilom, and bring their brethren into the city, that thereby they might eat, and drink, and rest them- selves from the labors of their journey ; for they had suffered many things; they had suffered hunger, thirst, and fatigue.
17 And now, it came to pass on the morrow that king Limhi sent a proclamation among all his people, that thereby they might gather themselves together to the “temple, to hear the words which he should speak unto them.
18 And it came to pass that when they had gathered themselves to- gether that he “spake unto them in this wise, saying: O ye, my people, lift up your heads and be com- forted; for behold, the time is at hand, or is not far distant, when we shall no longer be in subjection to our enemies, notwithstanding our many strugglings, which have been in vain; yet I trust there ’remaineth an effectual struggle to be made.
19. Therefore, lift up your heads, and rejoice, and put your “trust in ’God, in that God who was the God of Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob; and also, that God who ‘brought the children of “Israel-out of the land of Egypt, and caused that they should walk through the Red °’Sea on dry ground, and fed them with ‘manna that they might not perish in the wilderness; and many more things did he do for them.
MOSIAH 7:16-25
20 And again, that same God has brought our fathers “out of the land of Jerusalem, and has kept and preserved his people even until now; and behold, it is "because of our iniquities and abominations that he has brought us into bondage.
21 And yeallare witnesses this day, that Zeniff, who was made king over this people, he being “over-zealous to inherit the land of his fathers, therefore being deceived by the cunning and craftiness of king Laman, who having entered into a treaty with king Zeniff, and having yielded up into his hands the pos- sessions of a part of the land, or even the city of Lehi-Nephi, and the city of Shilom; and the land round about—
22 And all this he did, for the sole purpose of “bringing this people into subjection or into bondage. And behold, we at this time do pay *tribute to the king of the Laman- ites, to the amount of one half of our corn, and our barley, and even all our grain of every kind, and one half of the increase of our flocks and our herds; and even one half of all we have or possess the king of the Lamanites doth exact of us, or our lives.
23 And now, is not this grievous to be borne? And is not this, our affliction, great? Now behold, how great reason we have to “mourn.
24 Yea, I say unto you, great are the reasons which we have to “mourn; for behold how many of our brethren have been slain, and their blood has been spilt in vain, and all because of iniquity.
25 For if this people had not fallen into transgression the Lord would not have suffered that this great evil should come upon them. But behold,

they would not hearken unto his words; but there arose contentions among them, even so much that they did shed blood among them- selves.
26 And a “prophet of the Lord have they ’slain; yea, a chosen man of God, who told them of their wicked- ness and abominations, and proph- esied of many things which are to come, yea, even the coming of Christ.
27 And because he said unto them that Christ was the 7God, the Father of all things, andsaid that he should take upon him the "image of man, and it should be the ‘image after which man was created in the beginning; or in other words, he said that man was created after the image of 4“God, and that God should come down among the children of men, and take upon him flesh and blood, and go forth upon the face of the earth—
28 And now, because he said this, they did “put him to death; and many more things did they do which brought down the wrath of God upon them. Therefore, who wondereth that they are in bondage, and that they are smitten with sore afflictions?
29 For behold, the Lord hath said: I will not “succor my people in the day of their transgression; but I will hedge up their ways that they prosper not; and their doings shall be as a °stumbling block before them.
30 And again, he saith: If my people shall sow “filthiness they shall ’reap the ‘chaff thereof in the whirl- wind; and the effect thereofis poison.

31 And again he saith: If my | people shall sow filthiness they shall || reap the “east wind, which bringeth immediate destruction.
32 And now, behold, the promise of the Lord is fulfilled, and ye are smitten and afflicted.
33 But if ye will *turn to the Lord with full purpose of heart, and put your trust in him, and serve him | with all diligence of mind, if ye do || this, he will, according to his own will and pleasure, deliver you out of bondage.

Ammon teaches the people of Limhi— He learns of the twenty-four Jaredite plates— Ancient records can be trans- lated by seers—The gift of seership exceeds all others.
AND it came to pass that after king Limhi had made an end of “speaking to his people, for he spake many things unto them and only a few of them have I written in this book, he told his people all the things concerning their brethren who were in the land of Zarahemla.
2 And he caused that Ammon should stand up before the multi- tude, and rehearse unto them all that had happened unto their brethren from the time that ?Zeniff went up out of the land even until the time that he "himself came up out of the land.
3 And he also rehearsed unto them the last words which king Benjamin had “taught them, and explained them to the people of king Limhi, | so that they might understand all the words which he spake.

4 And it came to pass that after he had done all this, that king Limhi dismissed the multitude, and caused that they should return every one unto his own house.
5 And it came to pass that. he caused that the “plates which con- tained the "record of his people from the time that they left the ‘land of Zarahemla, should be brought be- fore Ammon, that he might read them.
6 Now, as soon as Ammon had read the record, the king inquired of him to know if he could “interpret lan- guages, and Ammon told him that he could not.
7 And the king’ said unto him: Being grieved for the afflictions of my people, I caused that “forty and three of my people should take a journey into the wilderness, that thereby they might find the land of Zarahemla, that: we might appeal unto our brethren to deliver us out of bondage.
8 And they were lost-in the wilder- ness for the space of “many days, yet they were diligent, and found not the land of Zarahemla but returned to this land, having trav- eled in'a land among many waters, having discovered a land which was covered with ’bones of men, and of beasts, and was also covered with ruins of buildings: of every kind, having discovered a land which had been peopled with a+ people who were as numerous as the hosts of Israel.
9 And for a testimony that the things that they had said are true they have brought “twenty-four plates which are filled with engrav- ings, and they are of pure gold.

12 And I say unto thee again: Knowest thou of any one that can translate? For I am desirous that these records should be translated into our language; for, perhaps, they will give us a knowledge of a rem- nant of the people who have been destroyed, from whence these rec- ords came; or, perhaps, they will give us’a knowledge of this very people who have been destroyed; and I am desirous to know the cause of their destruction.
13 Now Ammon said unto him: I can ‘assuredly tell thee, O king, of a man that can “translate the records; for he: has wherewith that he can look, and translate all records that are of ancient date; and it is a gift from God. And the things are called *interpreters, and no man can look in them except he be commanded, lest he should look for that he ought not and he should perish. And who- soever is commanded ‘to look in them, the same is called “seer.
14 And behold, the king of the people who are in the land of Zara- hemla is the man that is commanded to do these things, and who has this high gift from God.
15 And the king said that a “seer is greater than a prophet.
16 And Ammon said that a seer is a revelator and a prophet also; and a gift which is greater can no man

have, except he should possess the power of God, which no man can; yet a man may have great power given him from God.
17 But a seer can know of things which are past, and also of things which are to come, and by them shall all things be revealed, or, rather, shall secret things be made manifest, and hidden things shall come to light, and things which are not known shall be made known by them, and also things shall be made known by them which otherwise could not be known.
18 Thus God has provided a means that man, through faith, might work mighty miracles; therefore he be- cometh.a great benefit to his fellow beings.
19 And now, when Ammon had made an end of speaking these words the king rejoiced exceedingly, and gave thanks-to God, saying: Doubtless a “great, mystery is con- tained within these plates, and these interpreters were doubtless pre- pared for the purpose of unfolding all such mysteries to the children of men.
20 O how marvelous are the works of the Lord, and how long doth he suffer with his people; yea, and how *blind and impenetrable are the understandings of the children of men; for they will not seek wisdom, neither do they desire that she should rule over them!
21 Yea, they are as a wild flock which fleeth from the shepherd, and scattereth, and are driven, and are devoured by the beasts of the forest.

Zeniff leads a group from Zarahemla to possess the land of Lehi-Nephi— The Lamanite king permits them to inherit the land—There is war between the Lamanites and Zeniff’s people.
2], “ZENIFF, having been taught in all the language of the Nephites, and having had a knowledge of the land of “Nephi, or of the land of our fathers’ first inheritance, *and hav- ing been sent as a spy among the Lamanites that Imight spy out their forces, that our army might come upon them and destroy them—but when I saw that which was good among them I was desirous that they should not be destroyed.
2 Therefore, I contended with my brethren in the wilderness, for I would that our ruler should make a treaty with them; but he being an austere and a blood-thirsty man commanded that I should be slain; but I was rescued by the shedding of much blood; for father fought against father, and brother against brother, until the greater number of our army was destroyed in the wilderness; and we returned, those of us that were spared, to the land of Zarahemla, to relate that tale to their wives and their children.
3 And yet, I being “over-zealous to inherit the land of our fathers, col- lected as many as were desirous to go up to possess the land, and started again on our °journey into the wilderness to go up to the land; but we were smitten with famine and sore afflictions; for we were slow to remember the Lord our God.
4 Nevertheless, after many days’ wandering in the wilderness we pitched our tents in the place where our brethren were slain, which was near to the land of our fathers.
5 And it came to pass that I went again with four of my men into the
3a Omni 1: 27 (27-29); Mosiah 7: 21. b Mosiah 25: 5.
[*About 200 B.c.]
165
city, in unto the king, that I might know of the disposition of the king, and that I might know if I might go in with my people and: possess the land in peace.
6 And I went in unto the king, and he covenanted with me that I might possess the “land of Lehi-Nephi; and the land of Shilom.
7 And he also commanded that his people should depart out of the land, and I and my people went into the land that we might possess it.
8 And we began to build buildings, and: to\ repair the walls of the city, yea, even the walis of the city of Lehi-Nephi, and the city of Shilom.
9 And we began to till the ground, yea, even with all manner of “seeds, with seeds of corn, and of wheat, and of barley, and with neas, and with sheum, and with seeds of all manner of fruits; and we did begin to multiply and prosper in the land.
10 Now it was the cunning and the craftiness of king *Laman, to “bring my people into bondage, that he yielded up the land that we might possess it.
11 Therefore it came to pass, that after we had dwelt in the land for the space of *twelve years that king Laman began to grow uneasy, lest by any means my people should "wax strong in the land, and that they could not overpower them and bring them into bondage.
12 Now they were a “lazy and an bidolatrous people; therefore they were desirous to bring us into bond- age, that they might glut them- selves with the labors of our hands; yea, that they might: feast: them- selves upon the flocks of our fields.
13 Therefore it came to pass that king Laman began to stir up his

people that they should contend with my people; therefore there began to be wars and contentions in the land.
14 For, in the ¢thirteenth year of my reign in the land of Nephi, away on the south of the land of “Shilom, when my people were watering and *feeding their flocks, and tilling their lands, a numerous host of Lamanites came upon them and began to slay them, and to take off their flocks, and the corn of their fields.
15 Yea, and it came to pass that they fled, all that were not over- taken, even into the city of Nephi, and did call upon me for protection.
16 And it came to pass that I did arm them with bows, and with arrows, with swords, and with cimeters, and with clubs, and with slings, and with all manner of weapons which we could invent, and I and my people did go forth against the Lamanites to battle.
17 Yea, in the “strength of the Lord did we go forth to battle against the Lamanites; for I and my people did cry mightily to the Lord that he would deliver us out of the hands of our enemies, for we were awak- ened to a remembrance of the deliverance of our fathers.
18 And God did “hear our cries and did answer our prayers; and we did go forth in his might; yea, we did go forth against the Lamanites, and in one day and a night we did slay three thousand and forty-three; we did slay them even until we had driven them out of our land.
19 And I, myself, with mine own hands, did help to bury their dead. And behold, to our great sorrow and lamentation, two hundred and seventy-nine of our brethren were slain.

King Laman dies—His people are wild and ferocious and believe in false traditions—Zeniff and his people pre- vail against them.
AND it came to pass that we again began to establish the kingdom-and we again began to possess the land in peace. And I caused that there should be “weapons of war made of every kind, that thereby I might have weapons for my people against the time the Lamanites should come up again to war against my people.
2 And I set guards round about the land, that the Lamanites might not come upon us again unawares and destroy us; and thus I did guard my people and my flocks, and keep them from falling into the hands of our enemies.
3 And it came to pass that we did inherit the land of our fathers for many years, yea, *for the space of twenty and two years.
4 And I did cause that the men should till the ground, and raise all manner of “grain and all manner of fruit of every kind.
5 And I did cause that the women should spin, and toil, and work, and work all manner of fine linen, yea, and “cloth of every kind, that we might clothe our nakedness; and thus we did prosper in the land— thus we did have continual peace in the land for the space of twenty and two years.
6 And it came to pass that king “Laman died, and his son began to reign in his stead. And he began to stir his people up in rebellion against my people; therefore they began to prepare for war, and to come up to battle against my people.
7 But I had sent my spies out round about the land of “Shemlon, that I might discover their prepara-

tions, that I might guard against them, that they might not come upon my people and destroy them.
8 And it came to pass that they came up upon the north of the land of Shilom, with their numerous hosts, men “armed with "bows, and with arrows, and with swords, and with cimeters, and with stones, and with slings; and they had their heads shaved that they were naked; and they were girded with a leathern girdle about their loins.
9 And it came to pass that I caused that the women and children of my people should be hid in the wilder- ness; and I also caused that all my old men that could bear arms, and also all my young men that were able to bear arms, should gather themselves together to go to battle against the Lamanites; and I did place them in their ranks, every man according to his age.
10 And it came to pass that we did go up to battle against the Laman- ites; and I, even I, in my old age, did go up to battle against the Lamanites. And it came to pass that we did go up in the strength of the Lord to battle.
11 Now, the Lamanites knew nothing concerning the Lord, nor the strength of the Lord, therefore they depended upon their own strength. Yet they were a strong people, as to the “strength of men.
12 They were a “wild, and fero- cious, and a blood-thirsty people, believing in the tradition of their fathers, which is this—Believing that they were driven out of the land of Jerusalem because of. the iniquities of their fathers, and that they were ‘wronged in the wilder- ness by their brethren, and they were also wronged while crossing the sea ;
13 And again, that they were

167
wronged while in the land of their “first inheritance, after they had crossed the sea, and all this because that Nephi was more faithful- in keeping the commandments of the Lord—therefore "he was favored of the Lord, for the Lord heard his prayers and answered them, and he took the lead of their journey in the wilderness.
14 And his brethren were ?wroth with him because they "understood not the dealings of the Lord; they were also wroth with him upon the waters because they hardened their hearts against the Lord.
15 And again, they were “wroth with him when they had arrived in the promised land, because. they said that he had taken the "ruling of the people out of their hands; and they sought to kill him.
16 And again, they were wroth with him because he departed into the wilderness as the Lord had com- manded him, and took the “records which were engraven on the plates of brass, for they said that he ’robbed them.
17 And thus they have taught their children that they should hate them, and that they should murder them, and that they should rob and plun- der them, and do all they could to destroy them; therefore they have an eternal hatred towards the children of Nephi.
18 For this very cause has king Laman, by his “cunning, and lying craftiness, and his fair promises, deceived me, that I have brought this my people up into this land, that they may destroy them; yea, and we have suffered these many years in the land.

concerning the Lamanites, I did stimulate them to go to battle with their might, putting their trust in the Lord; therefore, we did contend with them, face to face.
20 And it came to pass that we did drive them again out of our land; and we slew them with a great slaughter, even so many that we did not number them.
21 And it came to pass that we returned again to our own land, and my people again began to “tend their flocks, and to till their ground.

CHAPTER 11
King Noah rules in wickedness—He revels in riotous living with his wives and concubines—Abinadi prophesies that the people will be taken into bondage—His life is sought by King Noah.
AND now it came to pass that Zeniff-conferred the kingdom upon Noah, one of his sons; therefore Noah began to reign in his stead; and he did not walk in the ways of his father.
2 For behold, he did not keep the commandments of God, but he did walk after the desires of his own heart.. And he had many wives and “concubines. And he did "cause his people to commit sin, and do that which was ‘abominable in the sight of the Lord. Yea, and they did commit ¢whoredoms and “all man- ner of wickedness.
3 And he. laid a “tax of one fifth part of all they possessed, a fifth part of their gold and of their silver,

MOSIAH 11:4-17
and a fifth part of their °ziff, and of their copper, and of their brass and their iron; anda fifth part of their fatlings; and also a fifth part of all their grain.
4 And all this did he take to “sup- port himself, and his wives and his *’concubines; and also his priests, and their wives and their concu- bines; thus he had changed the affairs of the kingdom.
5 For he put down all the priests that had been consecrated by his father, and consecrated new “ones in their stead, such as were lifted up in the pride of their hearts.
6 Yea, and thus they were sup- ported in their laziness, and in their idolatry, and in their whoredoms, by the taxes which king Noah had put upon his people; thus did the people labor exceedingly to support iniquity.
7 Yea, and they also became idolatrous, because they were de- ceived by the vain and flattering words of the king and priests; for they did speak flattering things unto them.
8 And it came to pass that king Noah built many elegant and spacious buildings; and he orna- mented them with fine work of wood, and of all manner of “precious things, of gold, and of silver, and of iron, and of brass, and of ziff, and of copper;
9 And he also built him a spacious palace, and a throne in the midst thereof, all of which was of fine wood and was ornamented with gold and silver and with precious things.
10 And he also caused that his workmen should work all manner of fine work within the walls of the “temple, of fine wood, and of copper, and of brass.

11 And the seats which were set apart for the “high priests, which were above all the other seats, he did ornament with pure gold; and he caused a breastwork to be built before them, that they might rest their bodies and their arms upon while they should speak lying and vain words to his people.
12 And it came to pass that he built a “tower near the temple; yea, a very high tower, even so high that he could stand upon the top thereof and overlook the land of °’Shilom, and also the land of “Shemion, which was possessed by the Lamanites; and he could even look over all the land round about.
13 And it came to pass that he caused many buildings to be built in the land Shilom; and he caused a great tower to be built on the “hill north of the land Shilom, which had been a resort for the children of Nephi at the time they °fled out of the land; and thus he did do with the riches which he obtained by the taxation of his people.
14 And it came to pass that he placed his heart upon his riches, and he spent his time in “riotous living with his wives and his concubines; and so did also his priests spend their time with harlots.
15 And it came to pass that he planted vineyards round about in the land; and he built wine-presses,
and made “wine in abundance; and |
therefore he became a wine-bibber, and also his people.
16 And it came to pass that the Lamanites began to come in upon
his people, upon small numbers, and_|
to slay them in their fields, and while they were tending their flocks. |
17 And king Noah sent guards round about the land to keep them

off; but he did not send a sufficient number, and the Lamanites came upon them and killed them, and drove many of their flocks out of the land; thus the Lamanites began to destroy them, and to exercise their hatred upon them. ;
18 And it came to pass that king Noah sent his armies against them, and they were driven back, or they drove them back for a time; there- fore, they returned rejoicing in their spoil.
19 And now, because of this great victory they were lifted up in the pride of their hearts; they did “boast in their own strength, saying that their fifty could stand against thousands of the Lamanites; and thus they did boast, and did delight in blood, and the shedding of the blood of their brethren, and. this because of the wickedness of their king and priests.
20 And it came to pass that there was a man among them whose name was “Abinadi; *and he went forth among them, and began toprophesy, saying: Behold, thus saith the Lord, and thus hath he commanded me, saying, Go forth, and say unto this people, thus saith the Lord—Wo be unto this people, for I have seen their abominations, and their wick- edness, and their whoredoms; and except they repent I will. 2visit them in mine anger.
21 And except they repent and turn to the Lord. their - God, behold, I will deliver them into the hands of their enemies; yea, and they shall be brought into “bond- age; and they shall be afflicted by the hand of their enemies.

they shall ?know that I am the Lord their God, and am a °jealous God, visiting the iniquities of my people.
23 And it shall come to pass that except this people repent and turn unto the Lord their God, they shall be brought into bondage; and none shall ¢deliver them, except it be the Lord the Almighty God.
24 Yea, and it shall come to pass that when they shall *cry unto me I will be ’slow to hear their cries; yea, and I will suffer them that they be smitten by their enemies.
25 And except they repent in *sackcloth and ashes, and cry mightily to the Lord their’ God, I will not "hear their prayers, neither will I deliver them out of their afflictions; and thus saith the Lord, and thus hath he commanded me.
26 Now it came to pass that when Abinadi had spoken these words unto them they were wroth with him, and sought to take away his life; but the Lord “delivered him out of their hands.
27 Now. when: king Noah had heard of the words which Abinadi had spoken unto the people, he was also wroth; and he said: *Who is Abinadi, that I and my people should be judged of him, or who is the Lord, that shall bring upon my people such great affliction?
28 I command: you ‘to’ bring Abinadi hither, that Imay slay him, for he has said these things that he might “stir up my people to anger one with another, and to raise con- tentions among my people; there- fore I will slay him.
29 Now the eyes of the people were “blinded; therefore they "hardened their hearts: against the words of

Abinadi, and they sought from that time forward to take him. And king Noah hardened his heart against the word of the Lord, and he did not repent of his evil doings.
CHAPTER 12
Abinadi is imprisoned for prophesy- ing the destruction of the people and the death of King Noah—The false priests quote the scriptures and. pre- tend to keep the law of Moses— Abinadi begins to teach them the Ten Commandments.
AND it came to pass that *after the space of two years that Abinadi came among them in disguise, that they Knew him not, and began to ¢prophesy among them, saying: Thus has the Lord commanded me, saying—Abinadi, go and prophesy unto this my people, for they have hardened their hearts against my words; they have repented not of their evil doings; therefore, I will bvisit them in my anger, yea, in my fierce anger will I visit them in their iniquitiesand abominations.
2 Yea, wo be unto this generation ! And the Lord said unto me: Stretch forth thy hand and prophesy, say- ing: Thus saith the Lord, it shall come to. pass that this generation, because of their iniquities, shall be brought into “bondage, and shall be smitten on the °cheek; yea, and shall be driven by men, and shall be slain; and the vultures of the air, and the dogs, yea, and the wild beasts, shall devour their “flesh.
3 And it shall come to pass that the life of king Noah shall be valued even as a garment in a hot ’furnace; for he shall know that I am the Lord.

And many things did Abinadi prophesy against this people.

And he pretendeth the Lord hath spoken it. And he saith all this shall come upon thee except thou repent, and this because of thine iniquities.
13 And now, O king, what great evil hast thou done, or what great sins have thy people committed, that we should be “condemned of God or judged of this man?
14 And now, O king, behold, we are “guiltless, and thou, O king, hast not sinned; therefore, this man has "lied concerning you, and he has prophesied in vain.
15 And behold, we are strong, we shall not come into bondage, or be taken captive by our enemies; yea, and thou hast prospered in the land, and thou shalt also prosper.
16 Behold, here is the man, we deliver him into thy hands; thou mayest do with him as seemeth thee good.
17 And it came to pass that king Noah caused that Abinadi should be cast into prison; and he com- manded that the “priests should gather themselves together that he might hold a council with them what he should do with him.
18 And it came to pass that they said unto the king: Bring him hither that we may question him; and the king commanded that he should be brought before them.
19 And they began to question him, that they might cross him, that thereby they might have wherewith to “accuse him; but he answered them boldly, and withstood all their

questions, yea, to their astonish- ment; for he did withstand them in all their questions, and did con- found them in all their words.
20 And it came to pass that one of them said unto him: 7?What meaneth the words which are written, and which have been taught by our fathers, saying:
21 °How beautiful upon the moun- tains are the feet of him "that bring- eth good tidings; that publisheth peace; that bringeth good tidings of good; that publisheth salvation; that saith unto. Zion, Thy God reigneth;

24 The Lord hath made bare his holy “arm in the eyes of all the nations, and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our God?
25 And now Abinadi said unto them: Are you “priests, and pretend to teach this people, and to under- stand the spirit of prophesying, and yet desire to know of me what these things mean?
26 1 say unto you, wo be unto you for perverting the ways of the Lord! For if ye understand these things ye have not taught them; therefore, ye have perverted the ways of the Lord.
27 Ye have not applied your “hearts to "understanding; there- fore, ye have not been wise. There- fore, what teach ye this people?
28 And they said: We teach the law of Moses.
29 And again he said unto them:

MOSIAH 12:30-13:7
If ye teach the “law of Moses why do ye not keep it? Why do ye set your hearts upon ’riches? Why do ye commit whoredoms and “spend your strength with harlots, yea, and cause this people to commit sin, that the Lord has cause to send me. to prophesy against this people, yea, even a great evil against this people?
30 Know ye not that I speak the ‘truth? Yea, ye know that I speak the truth; and you ought to tremble before God.
31 And it shall come to pass that ye shall be smitten for your iniqui- ties, for ye have said that ye teach the law of Moses. And what know ye concerning the law of Moses? 2Doth salvation come by the law of Moses? What say ye?
32 And they answered and said that salvation did come by the law of Moses.
33 But now Abinadi said unto them: I know if ye “keep the com- mandments of God ye shall be saved; yea, if ye keep the com- mandments which the Lord deliver- ed unto Moses in the mount of Sinai, saying:
34 °I am the Lord thy God, who hath "brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.
35 Thou shalt have no “other God before me.
36 *Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing in heaven above, or things which are in the earth beneath.
37 Now Abinadi said unto them, Have ye done all this? I say unto you, Nay, ye have not. And have ye “taught this people that they should do all these things? I say unto you, Nay, ye have not.

Abinadi is protected by divine power— | He teaches the Ten Commandments— | Salvation does not come by the law of | Moses alone—God himself shall | make an atonement and redeem his | people.
AND now when the king had heard | these words, he said unto his priests: | Away with this fellow, and slay | him; for what have we to do with | him, for he is *mad. |
2 And they stood forth and | attempted to lay their hands on him; but he withstood them, and | said unto them:
3 "Touch me not, for God shall || smite you if yelay your hands upon | me, for I have not delivered the || message which the Lord sent me to deliver; neither have I told you that | which ye "requested that I should tell; therefore, God will not suffer | that I shall be destroyed at this | time.
4 But I must fulfil the command- ments wherewith God has com- manded me; and because I have told you the truth ye are angry with me. And again, because I have spoken the word of God ye have judged me that lammad.
5 Now it came to pass after Abinadi had spoken these words | that the people of king Noah durst not lay their hands on him, for the Spirit of the Lord was upon him; and his face “shone with exceeding || luster, even as Moses’ did while in the mount of Sinai, while speaking | with the Lord. |

slay me, therefore I finish my “mes- sage. Yea, and I perceive that it cuts you to your hearts. because I tell you the truth concerning your iniquities.
8 Yea, and my words fill you with wonder and amazement, and with anger.
9 But I finish my message; and then it “matters not whither I go, if it so be that lamsaved.
10 But this much I tell you, what you “do with me, after this, shall be as a type and a shadow of things which are to come.
11 And now I read unto you the remainder of the “commandments of God, for I perceive that they are not written in your hearts; I per- ceive that ye have studied and taught iniquity the most part of your lives.
12 And now, ye remember that I said unto you: Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of things which are in heaven above, or which are in the earth beneath, or which are in the waterunder the earth.
13 And again: Thou shalt not *bow down thyself unto them, nor serve them; for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquities of the fathers upon the children, unto the third and fourth genera- tions of them that hate me;
14 And showing mercy unto thou- sands of them that Jove me and keep my commandments.
15 Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain; for the Lord will not hold him “guiltless that taketh his name in vain.
16 Remember the “sabbath day, to keep it holy.
MOSIAH 13:8-27
17 Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work;
18 But the seventh day, the sab- bath of the Lord thy God, thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy man-servant, nor thy miaid-servant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates;
19 For in “six days the Lord made heaven and earth, and the sea, and all that in them is; wherefore. the Lord blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.
20 “Honor thy father and thy mother, that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.
21 Thou shalt not °kill.
22 Thou shalt not commit “adul- tery. Thou shalt not ’steal.
23. Thou ‘shalt not bear “false witness against thy neighbor.
24 Thou shalt not ?covet thy neighbor’s house, thou ‘shalt not covet thy neighbor’s wife, nor his man-servant, nor his maid-servant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor anything thatis thy neighbor’s.
25 And it came to pass that after Abinadi had made an end of these sayings that he said unto them: Have ye “taught this people that they should observe to do all these things for to keep these command- ments?
26 I say unto you, Nay; for if ye had, the Lord would not have caused me to come forth and to prophesy evil concerning this people.
27 And now ye have said that sal- vation cometh by the law of Moses. I say unto you that it is expedient that ye should “keep the law of Moses as yet; but I say unto you,

that the time shall come when it shall *no more be expedient to keep the law of Moses.
28 And moreover, I say unto you, that “salvation doth not come by the "law alone; and were it not for the ‘atonement, which God himself shall make for the sins and iniquities of his people, that they must un- avoidably perish, notwithstanding the law of Moses.
29 And now I say unto you that it was expedient that there should be a law given to the children of Israel, yea, even a very “strict law; for they were a stiffmecked people, *quick to do iniquity, and slow to remember the Lord their God;
30 Therefore there was a “law given them, yea, a law of perform- ances and of ordinances, a law which they were to “observe strictly from day to day, to keep them in remembrance of God and their duty towards him.
31 But behold, I say unto you, that all these things were “types of things to come.
32 And now, did they “understand the law? I say unto you, Nay, they did not all understand the law; and this because of the hardness of their hearts; for they understood not that there could not any man be saved bexcept it were through the redemp- tion of God.
33 For behold, did not Moses prophesy unto them concerning the coming of the Messiah, and that God should redeem his people? Yea, and even “all the prophets: who have
174
prophesied ever since the world began—have they not spoken more or less concerning these things ?
34 Have they not said that *God | himself should come down among © the children of men, and take upon him the form of man, and go forth in mighty power upon the face of the earth?
35 Yea, and have they not said also that he should bring to pass the “resurrection of the dead, and that he, himself, should ‘be oppressed and afflicted?
CHAPTER 14
Isaiah speaks Messianically—Mes- siah’s humiliation and sufferings are set forth—He makes his soul an offer- ing for sin and makes intercession for transgressors—Compare Isaiah 53. .
YEA, eyen doth not Isaiah say: Who hath “believed our report, and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed ?
2 For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and asa root out of dry ground; he hath no form nor comeliness; and when we shall. see him there is no beauty that we should desire him.
3 He is “despised and rejected of men; aman of sorrows, and acquain- ted with grief; and we hid as it were our faces from him ; he was despised, and we esteemed him not.
4 Surely he has “borne our °griefs, and carried our sorrows; yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.

5 But he was “wounded for our *transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are ‘healed.
6 All we, like “sheep, have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquities of us all.
7 He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he. “opened not his mouth; he is brought as a "lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb so he opened not his mouth.
8 He was taken from prison and from judgment; and who shall declare his generation? For he was cut off out of the land of the living; for the transgressions of my people was he stricken.
9. And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the “rich in his death; because he had. done no ’evil, neither was any deceit in his mouth.

24 And these are those who have part in-the first resurrection; and these are they that have died before Christ came, in their ignorance, not having “salvation declared unto them. And thus the Lord bringeth about the restoration of these; and they have a part in the first resur- rection, or have eternal life, being redeemed by the Lord.
25 And little “children also have eternal life.

they shall see eye to eye, when the Lord shall bring again Zion.
30 Break forth into joy, sing to- gether, ye waste places of Jerusa- lem; for the Lord hath comforted his people, he hath redeemed Jerusalem.
31 The Lord hath made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the nations; and all the ends of the earth shall see the “salvation of our God.
CHAPTER 16
God redeems men from their lost and fallen state—Those who are carnal remain as though there was no redemption—Christ brings to pass a resurrection to endless life or to end- less damnation.
AND now, it came to pass that after Abinadi had spoken these words he stretched forth his hand and said: The time shall come when all shall see the “salvation of the Lord; when "every nation, kindred, tongue, and people shall see eye to eye and shall ‘confess before God that his “judgments are just.
2 And then shall the “wicked be *cast out, and they shall have cause to howl, and ‘weep, and wail, and gnash their teeth; and this because they would not “hearken unto the voice of the Lord; therefore the Lord redeemeth them not.
3 For they are “carnal and devilish, and the devil has power over them;
yea, even that old serpent that did | *beguile our first parents, which | was the ‘cause of their fall; which | was the cause of “all mankind be- | coming carnal, sensual, devilish, | ‘knowing evil from good, ‘subject- | ing themselves to the devil.
4 Thus all mankind were “lost; and | behold, they would have been end- | lessly lost were it not that God re- | deemed his people from their lost | and fallen state.
5 But remember that he that per- sists in his own “carnal nature, and | goes on in the ways of sin and rebellion against God, remaineth in | his fallen state and the “devil hath | all power over him. Therefore he is | as though there was no ‘redemption | made, being an enemy to God; and | also is the ¢devil an enemy to God.
6 And now if Christ had not come || into the world, speaking of things | to come “as though they had | already come, there could have been no redemption.
7 And if Christ had not risen from the dead, or have broken the bands | of death that the grave should have no victory, and that death should have no “sting, there could have been no resurrection.
8 But there is a “resurrection, therefore the grave hath no victory, | and the sting of °death is swallowed | up in Christ.
9 He is the “light and the life of the | world; yea, a light that is endless, |

10 Even this mortal shall put on “immortality, and this °corruption shall put on incorruption, and shall be brought to ‘stand before the bar of God, to be judged of him accord- ing to their works whether they be good or whether they be evil—

13 And now, ought ye not to tremble and repent of your sins, and remember that only in and through Christ ye can be saved?

AND now it came to. pass that when Abinadi had finished these sayings, that the king commanded that the “priests should take him and cause that he should be put to ’death.
2 But there was one among them whose name was 7Alma,' he also being a descendant of Nephi. And he was a young man, and he ’believed the words which Abinadi had spoken, for he knew concerning the iniquity which Abinadi had testified against them; therefore he began to plead with the king that he would not be angry with Abinadi, but suffer that he might depart in peace.
3 But the king was more wroth, and caused that Alma should be cast out from among them, and sent his servants after him that they might slay him.
4 But he fled from before them and “hid himself that they found him not. And he being concealed for many days did °write all the words which Abinadi had spoken.
5 And it came to pass that the king caused that his guards should surround Abinadi and take him; and they bound him and ‘cast him into prison.
6 And after three days, having counseled with his “priests,' he caused that he should again be brought before him.
7 And he said unto him: Abinadi, we have found an accusation against thee, and thou art worthy of death.

the children of men; and now, for this cause thou shalt be put to death unless. thou wilt recall all the words which thou hast spoken evil concerning me and my people.
9 Now Abinadi said unto him: I say unto you, I will “not recall the words which I have spoken unto you concerning this people, for they are true; and that yemay know of theirsurety I have suffered myself that I have fallen into your hands.
10 Yea, and I will “suffer even until death, and I will not recall my words, and they shall stand as a *testimony against you. And if ye slay me ye will shed ‘innocent blood, and this shall also stand as a testi- mony against you at the last day.
11 And now king Noah was about to release him, for he feared his word; for he feared that the judg- ments of God would come upon him.
12 But the “priests lifted up their voices against him, and began to accuse him, saying: He has reviled the king. Therefore the king was stirred up in °anger against him, and he delivered him up that he might be slain.
13 And it came to pass that they took him and bound him, and “scourged his skin with faggots, yea, even unto ’death.
14 And now when the flames began to scorch him, he cried unto them, saying:
15 Behold, even as ye have done unto me, so shall it come to pass that thy “seed shall cause that many shall suffer the pains that I do suffer, even the pains of °death by fire; and this because they believe in the salvation of the Lord their God.

3 And as many as would hear his word he did teach. And he taught them. privately, that it might not come to the knowledge of the king. And many did believe his words.
4 And it came to pass that as many as did believe him did go forth to a “place which was called Mormon, having received its name from the king, being in the °borders of the land having been infested, by times or at seasons, by wild beasts.
5 Now, there was in Mormon a fountain of pure water, and Alma tesorted thither, there being near the water a thicket of small trees, where he did hide himself in the daytime from the searches of the king.
6 And it came to pass that as many as believed him went thither to hear his words.
7 And it came to pass *after many days there were a goodly number gathered together at the place of Mormon, to hear the words of Alma. Yea, all were gathered together that believed on his word, to hear him. And he did “teach them, and did preach unto them_ repentance, and redemption, and faith on the Lord.
8 And it came to pass that he said unto them: Behold, here are the waters of Mormon (for thus were they called) and now, as ye are “desirous to come into the °fold of God, and to be called his people, and are willing to bear one another’s burdens, that they may be light;

comfort those that:stand in need of comfort, and to stand as ‘witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all places that ye may be in, even until death, that ye may be redeemed of God, and be numbered with those of the “first resurrection, that ye may have eternal life—
10 Now I say unto you, if this be the desire of your hearts, what have you against being “baptized in the *’name of the Lord, as a witness before him that ye have entered into a ‘covenant with him, that ye will serve him and keep his. com- mandments, that he may pour out his Spirit more abundantly upon you?
11 And now when the people had heard these words, they clapped their hands for joy, and exclaimed: This is the desire of our hearts.
12 And now it came to pass that Alma took Helam, he being one of the first, and went and stood forth in the water, and cried, saying: O Lord, pour out thy Spirit upon thy servant, that he may do this work with holiness of heart.
13 And when he had said these words, the “Spirit of the Lord was upon him, and he said: Helam, I baptize thee, having “authority from the Almighty God, as a:testi- mony that ye have entered into a “covenant to serve him until you are dead as to the mortal body; and may the Spirit of the Lord be poured out upon you; and may he grant unto you eternal life, through the redemption of Christ, whom he has prepared from the “foundation of the world.

“buried in the water; and they arose and came forth out of the water rejoicing, being filled with the Spirit.
15 And again, Alma took another, and went forth a second time into the water, and baptized him accord- ing to the first, only he did not bury “himself again in the water.
16 And after this manner he did baptize every one that went forth to the place of Mormon; and they were in number about two hundred and four souls; yea, and they were “baptized in the waters of Mormon, and were filled with the ’grace of God.
17 And they were called the church of God, or the “church of Christ, from that time forward. And it came to pass that whosoever was baptized by the power and author- ity of God was added to his church.
18 And it came to pass that Alma, having “authority from God, "or- dained priests; even one priest to every fifty of their number did he ordain to preach unto them, and to ‘teach them concerning the things pertaining to the kingdom of God.
19 And he commanded them that “they should ’teach nothing save it were the things which he had taught, and which had been spoken by the mouth of the holy prophets.
20 Yea, even he commanded them that they should “preach nothing save it were repentance and faith on the Lord, who had redeemed his people.
21 And he commanded them that

there should be no “contention one | with another, but that they should | look forward with °one eye, having | one faith and one baptism, having their hearts ‘knit together in unity and in love one towards another.
22 And thus he commanded them to preach. And thus they became the “children of God.
23 And he commanded them that they should observe the “sabbath day, and keep it holy, and also every day they should give thanks to the Lord their God.
24 And he also commanded them > that the priests whom he had ordained “should "labor with their | own hands for their support.
25 And there was “one day in every | week that was set apart that they | should °gather themselves together | to teach the people, and to worship the Lord their God, and also, as often as it was in their power, to ‘assemble themselves together.
26 And the priests were not to depend upon the people for their | support; but for their labor they | were to receive the “grace of God, that they might wax strong in the | Spirit, having the "knowledge of | God, that they might teach with power and authority from God.

AND it came to pass that the “army of the king returned, having searched in vain for the people of the Lord.
2 And now behold, the forces of the king were small, having been re- duced, and there began to be a division among the remainder of the people.
3 And the lesser part began to “breathe out threatenings against the king, and there began to be a great contention among them.
4 And now there was a man among them whose name was Gideon, and he being a strong man and an enemy to the king, therefore he drew his sword, and swore in his wrath that he would slay the king.
5 And it came to pass that he fought with the king; and when the king saw that he was about to over- power him, he fled and ran and got upon the “tower which was near the temple.
6 And Gideon pursued after him and was about to get upon the tower to slay the king, and the king cast his eyes round about towards the land of “Shemlon, and behold, the army of the Lamanites were within the borders of the land.

he was about his “own life; never- theless, Gideon did spare his life.

10 And it came to pass that the Lamanites did pursue them, and did overtake them, and began to slay them.
11 Now it came to pass that the king commanded them that all the men should “leave their wives and their children, and flee before the Lamanites.
12 Now there were many that would not leave them, but had rather stay and perish with them. And the rest left their wives and their children and fled.
13 And it came to pass that those who tarried with their wives and their children caused that their fair daughters should stand forth and plead with the Lamanites that they would not slay them.
14 And it came to pass that the Lamanites had compassion on them, for they were charmed with the beauty of their women.
15 Therefore the Lamanites did spare their lives, and took them captives and carried them back to the land of Nephi, and granted unto them that they might possess the land, under the conditions that they would. deliver up king Noah into the hands of the Lamanites, and deliver up their property, even “one half of all they possessed, one half of their gold, and their silver, and all their precious things, and thus they should pay tribute to the king of the Lamanites from year to year.

26 And also Limhi, being the son of the king, having the kingdom conferred upon him “by the people, made oath unto the king of the Lamanites that his people should pay ‘tribute unto him, even one half of all they possessed.
27 And it came to pass that Limhi began to establish the kingdom and to establish “peace. among his people.
28 And the king of the Lamanites set “guards round about the-land, that he might ’keep the people of Limhi in the land, that they might not depart into the wilderness; and he did support his guards out of the tribute which he did. receive from the Nephites.
29 And now king Limhi did have continual peace in his. kingdom for the space of two. years, that the Lamanites did not molest them nor seek to destroy them.
CHAPTER 20
Lamanite daughters are abducted by the priests of Noah—The Lamanites wage war upon Limhi and his people —They are repulsed and pacified.
Now there was a place in “Shem- lon where the daughters of. the Lamanites did gather themselves together to sing, and to ’dance, and to make themselves merry.
2 And it came to pass that there was one day a small number of them gathered together.to sing and to dance.
3 And now the priests of king Noah, being ashamed to return to the city of Nephi, yea, and also fearing that the people would “slay them, there- fore they durst not return to their wives and their °children.

4 And having tarried in the wilder- ness, and having discovered the daughters of the Lamanites, they laid and watched them;
5 And when there were but few of them gathered together to dance, they came forth out of their secret places and took them and carried them into the. wilderness; yea, twenty and four of the *daughters of the Lamanites they carried into the wilderness.
6 And it came to pass that when the Lamanites found that their daughters had been missing, they were angry with the people of Limhi, for they thought it was the people of Limhi.
7 Therefore they sent their armies forth; yea, even the king himself went before his people; and they went up to the land of Nephi to destroy the people of Limhi.
8 And now. Limhi had discovered them from the “tower, even all their preparations for war did he dis- cover; therefore he gathered his people together, and laid wait for them in the fields and in the forests.
9 And it came to pass that when the Lamanites had come up, that the people of Limhi began ‘to fall upon them from their” waiting places, and began to slay them.
10 And it came to pass that the battle became. exceedingly sore, for they fought like lions for their prey.
11 And it came to pass that the people of Limhi began to drive the Lamanites before them; yet they were not half so numerous as the Lamanites. But they “fought for their lives, and for their ’wives, and for their children; therefore they exerted themselves and like dragons did they fight.
12 And it came to pass that they found the king of the Lamanites

among thenumber of their dead; yet he was not dead, having been wound- ed and left upon the ground, so speedy was the flight of his people.
13, And they took him and bound up his wounds, and brought him before Limhi, and said: Behold, here is the king of the Lamanites; he having: received a wound has fallen among their dead, and they have left him; and behold, we have brought him before you; and now let us slay him.
14 But Limhi said unto them: Ye shall not slay him, but bring him hither that I may see him. And they brought him. And Limhi said unto him: What cause have ye to come up to war against my people? Be- hold, my people have not broken the oath that I made unto you; there- fore, why should ye break the oath which ye made unto my people?
15 And now the king said: I have broken. the oath because thy people did carry away the daughters of my people; therefore, in my anger I did cause my people to come up to war against thy people.
16 And now Limhi had heard nothing concerning this matter; therefore he said: I will search among my people and whosoever has done this thing shall perish. Therefore he caused a search to be made among his people.
17 Now when “Gideon had heard these things, he being the king’s captain, he went forth and said unto the king: I pray thee forbear,:and do not search this people, and lay not this thing to their charge.
18 For do ye not remember the priests of thy father, whom this people sought to destroy? And are they not in the wilderness? And are not they the ones who have stolen the daughters of the Lamanites?

20 And behold, they come with their numerous hosts; and except the king doth pacify them towards us we must perish.
21 For are not the words of Abinadi “fulfilled, which he proph- esied against us—and all this because we would not hearken unto the words of the Lord, and turn from our iniquities ? p
22 And now let us pacify the king, | and we fulfil the “oath which we have made unto him; for it is better that we should be in bondage than that we should lose our °lives; therefore, let us put a stop to the shedding of so much blood. 1
23 And now Limhi told the king all the things concerning his father, | and the “priests that had fled into the wilderness, and attributed the carrying away of their daughters to them.
24 And it came to pass that the king . was. pacified towards his people;.and he said unto them: Let us go forth to meet my people, with- out arms; and I swear unto you with an “oath that my people shall not slay thy people.
25 And it came to pass that they | followed the king, and went forth | without arms to meet the Laman- ites. And it came to pass that they | did meet the Lamanites; and the || king of the Lamanites did bow him- | self down before them, and did plead in behalf of the people of | Limhi.
26 And when the Lamanites saw the people of Limhi, that they were | without arms, they had *compas- — sion on them and were. pacified | towards them, and returned with | their king in peace to their own land.

AND it came to pass, that Limhi and his people returned to the city of Nephi, and began to dwell in the land again in peace.
2 And it came to pass that after many days the Lamanites began again to be stirred up in anger against the Nephites, and they began to come into the borders of the land round about.
3 Now they durst not slay them, because of the “oath which their king had made unto Limhi; but they. would smite them on their *cheeks, and exercise authority Over them; and began to put heavy ‘burdens upon their backs, and drive them as they would a dumb ass—
4 Yea, all this was done that the 4word of the Lord might be "fulfilled.
5 And now the afflictions of the Nephites were great, and there was no way that they could deliver themselves out of their hands, for the Lamanites had “surrounded them on every side.
6 And it came to pass that the people began to murmur with the king because of their afflictions ; and they began to be desirous to go against them to battle. And they did afflict the king sorely with their complaints; therefore he granted unto them that they should do according to their desires.
7 And they gathered themselves together again, and put on their armor, and went forth against the

Lamanites to- drive them out Of their land.
8 And it came to pass that the Lamanites did beat them, and drove them back, and “slew many of them.
9 And now there was a great “mourning and lamentation among the people of Limhi, the widow mourning for her husband, the son and the daughter mourning for their father, and the brothers for their brethren.
10 Now there were a great many *widows in the land, and they did cry mightily from day today, fora great fear of the Lamanites had come upon them.
11 And it came to pass that their continual cries did stir up the remainder of the people of Limhi to anger against the Lamanites; and they went again to battle, but they were driven back again, suffering much loss.
12 Yea, they went again even the third time, and suffered in the like manner; and those that were not slain returned again to the city of Nephi.
13 And they did humble them- selves even to the dust, subjecting themselves to the “yoke of bondage, *’submitting themselves to be smit- ten, and to be driven to and fro, and burdened, according to the desires of their enemies.
14 And they did “humble them- selves even in the depths of humil- ity; and they did cry mightily to God; yea, even all the day long did they cry unto their God that he would deliver them out of their afflictions.

did hear their ’cries, and began to soften the hearts of the Lamanites that they began to ease their bur- dens; yet the Lord did not see fit to deliver them out of bondage.
16 And it came to pass that they began to prosper by degrees in the land, and began to raise grain more abundantly, and flocks, and herds, that they did not suffer with hunger.
17 Now there was a great number of women, more than there was of men; therefore king Limhi com- manded that every man should ‘impart to the support of the bwidows and their children, that they might not perish with hunger; and this they did because of the greatness of their number that had been slain.
18 Now the people of Limhi kept together in a body as much as it was possible, and secured their grain and their flocks;
19 And the king himself did not trust his person without the walls of the. city, unless he took his guards with him, fearing that he might by some means fall into the hands of the Lamanites.
20 And-he caused that his people should watch the land round about, that by some means they might take those priests that fled into the wilderness, who had stolen the “daughters of the Lamanites, and that had caused such a great destruc- tion to come upon them.
21 For they were desirous to take them that they might “punish them; for they had come into the land of Nephi by night, and carried off their grain and many of their precious things; therefore they laid wait for them.
22 And it came to pass that there was no more disturbance between the Lamanites and the people of

27 And they brought a “record with them, even a record of the | people whose bones they had found; | | and it was engraven on plates of ore.
28 And now Limhi was again filled with joy on learning from the mouth of Ammon that king Mosiah had a “gift from God, whereby he could *interpret such engravings; yea, and Ammon also did rejoice. |

many of their brethren had been 4slain;
30 And also that king Noah and his priests had caused the people to commit so many sins and iniquities against God; and they also. did mourn for the ‘death of Abinadi; and also for the °departure of Alma and the people that went with him, who had formed a church of God through the strength and power of God, and faith on the words which had been spoken by Abinadi.
31 Yea, they did mourn for their departure, for they knew not whither they had fled. Now they would have gladly joined with them, for they themselves had entered into a “covenant with God to serve him and keep his commandments.
32 And now since the coming of Ammon, king Limhi had also en- tered into a covenant with God, and also many of his people, to serve him and keep his commandments.
33 And it came to pass that king Limhi and many of his people were desirous to be baptized; but there was none in the land that had “authority from God. And Ammon declined doing this thing, consider- ing himself an unworthy servant.
34 Therefore they did not at that time form themselves into a*church, waiting upon the Spirit of the Lord. Now they were desirous to become even as Alma and his brethren, who had fled into the wilderness.
35 They were desirous to be bap- tized as a witness and a testimony that they were willing to serve God with all their hearts; nevertheless they did prolong the time; and an account of their baptism shall be | “given hereafter.
36 And now all the study of Am- mon and “his people, and. king Limhi and his people, was to deliver themselves out of the hands of the
‘| Lamanites and from bondage.

CHAPTER 22
Plans are made for the people to escape from Lamanite bondage— The. Lamanites are made drunk— The people escape, return to Zara- hemla, and become subject to King Mosiah.
AND now it came to pass that Ammon and king Limhi: began to consult with the people how they should “deliver themselves out of bondage; and even they did cause that all the people should gather themselves together; and this they did that they might have the voice of the people concerning the matter.
2 And it came to pass that they could find no way to deliver them- selves out of bondage, except it were to take their women and. children, and their flocks, and their herds, and their tents, and depart into the wilderness; for the Lamanites being so numerous, it was impossible for the people of Limhi to contend with them, thinking to deliver them- selves out of bondage by the sword.
3 Now it came to pass that 4Gideon went forth and stood before the king, and said unto him: Now O king, thou hast hitherto heark- ened unto my words many times when we have been contending with our brethren, the Lamanites.
4 And now 0 king, if thou hast not found me to be an. unprofitable ser- vant, or if thou hast hitherto listened to my words in any degree, and they have been of service to thee, even so I desire that thou wouldst listen to my words at this time, and I will be thy servant and deliver_this people out of bondage.

are ‘drunken; therefore let us send a proclamation among all this people that they gather together their flocks and herds, that they may drive them into the wilderness by night.
7 And I will go according to thy command and pay the last “tribute of wine to the Lamanites, and they will be °drunken; and we will pass through the secret pass on the left of their camp when they are drunk- en and asleep.
8 Thus we will depart with our women and our children, our flocks, and our herds into the wilderness; and we will travel around the land of *Shilom.
9 And it came to pass that the king hearkened unto the words of Gideon.
10 And king Limhi caused that his people should gather their flocks together; and he sent the tribute of wine to the Lamanites; and he also sent more wine, as a present unto them; and they did=drink freely of the wine which king Limhi did send unto them.
11 And it came to pass that the people of king Limhi did “depart by night into the wilderness with their flocks and their herds, and they went round about the land of >Shilom in the wilderness, and bent their course towards the land of Zarahemla, being led by Ammon and his brethren.
12 And they had taken all their gold, and silver, and their precious things, which they could carry, and also their provisions with them, into the wilderness; and they pursued their journey.
13 And after being many daysin the wilderness they “arrived in the land of Zarahemla, and joined Mosiah’s people, and became his subjects.

"received them with joy; and he also received their “records, and also the ‘records which had been found by the people of Limhi.
15 And now it came to pass when the Lamanites had found that the people of Limhi had departed out of the land by night, that they sent an “army into the wilderness to pursue them;
16 And after they had pursued them two days, they could no longer follow their tracks; therefore they were lost in the wilderness.

Alma refuses to be king—He serves as high priest—The Lord chastens his people, and the Lamanites conquer the land of Helam—Amulon, leader of King Noah’s wicked priests, rules subject to the Lamanite monarch.
‘Now Alma, having been “*warned
of the Lord that the armies of king Noah would come upon them, and having made it known to his people, therefore they gathered together their flocks, and took of their grain, and ’departed into the wilderness before the armies of king Noah.
2 And the Lord did strengthen them, that the people of king Noah could not overtake them to destroy them.
3 And they fled ‘eight days’ jour- ney into the wilderness.
4 And they came to a land, yea, even a very beautiful and pleasant land, a land of pure water.
5 And they pitched their tents, and began to till the ground, and began.

6 And the people were desirous that Alma should be their “king, for he was beloved by his. people.
7 But he said unto them: Behold, it is not expedient that we should have a king; for thus saith the Lord: Ye shall “not esteem one flesh above another, or one man shall not think himself above another; therefore I say unto you it is not expedient that ye should havea king.
8 Nevertheless, if it “were possible that ye could always have just men to be your ’kings it would be well for you to havea king.
9 But remember the “iniquity of king Noah and his "priests; and I myself was “caught in a‘snare, and did many things which were abom- inable in the sight of the Lord, which caused me sore “repentance;
10 Nevertheless, “after much °trib- ulation, the Lord did hear my cries, and did answer my prayers, and has made me an ‘instrument: in his hands in bringing “so many of you to a knowledge of his truth.
11 Nevertheless, in this I do not glory, for I am unworthy to glory of myself.
12 And now I say unto you, ye have been “oppressed by king. Noah, and have been in bondage to him and his priests, and have been ’brought into iniquity by them; therefore ye were bound with the “bands of iniquity.

15 Thus did Alma teach his people, that every man should “love his ’neighbor ‘as himself, that there should be no “contention among them.
16 And now, Alma was their “high priest, he being the founder of their church.
17 And it came to pass that none received “authority to preach or to teach except it were by him from God. Therefore he ’consecrated all their priests and all their teachers; and none were ‘consecrated except they were just men.
18 Therefore they did watch over their people, and did “nourish them with things pertaining to righteous- ness.
19 And it came to pass that they began to prosper exceedingly in the land; and they called the land “Helam.
20 And it came to pass that. they did multiply and prosper exceed- ingly in the land of Helam; and they built a city, which they called the city of Helam.

22 Nevertheless—whosoever put- teth his *trust in him the same shall be “lifted up at the last day: Yea, and thus it was with this people.
23 For behold, I will show unto you that they were brought into "bondage, ‘and none could deliver them but the Lord their God, yea, even the God of Abraham and Isaac and of Jacob.
24 And it came to pass that he did deliver them, and he did show forth his mighty power unto them, and great were their rejoicings.
25 For behold, it came to pass that while they were in the land of Helam, yea, in the city of Helam, while tilling the land round about, behold an army of the Lamanites was in the borders of the land.
26 Now it came to pass that the brethren of Alma fled from their fields, and gathered themselves together in the city of Helam; and they were much frightened because of the appearance of the Lamanites.
27 But Alma went forth and stood among them, and exhorted them that they should not be frightened, but that they should remember the Lord their God and he would deliver them.
28 Therefore they hushed their fears, and began to cry unto the Lord that he would soften the hearts of the Lamanites, that they would spare them, and their wives, and their children.
29 And it came to pass that the Lord did soften the hearts of the Lamanites. And Alma and_ his brethren went forth and delivered themselves up into their hands; and the Lamanites took possession of the land of Helam.

34 And the Lamanites had “com- | passion on Amulonandhis brethren, | and did not destroy them, because of their wives.
35 And *Amulon and his brethren did join the Lamanites, and they were traveling in the wilderness in search of the land of Nephi when they discovered the land of Helam, which was possessed by Alma and his brethren.
36 And it came to pass that the
‘Lamanites promised unto Alma and
his brethren, that if they would show them the *way which led to the land of Nephi that they would grant unto them their lives and their liberty.
37 But after Alma had shown them the way that. led to the land of Nephi the Lamanites would not keep their promise; but they set “guards round about the land of Helam, over Alma and his brethren. 38 And the remainder of them went to the land of Nephi; and a part of them returned to the land of Helam, and also brought with them | the wives and the children of the guards who had been left in theland. |

39 And the king of the Lamanites had granted unto Amulon that he should be a king and a ruler over his people, who were in the land of Helam; nevertheless he should have no power to do anything contrary to the will of the king of the
Lamanites.
CHAPTER 24
Amulon persecutes Alma and his people—They are to be put to death if they pray—The Lord makes their burdens seem light—He delivers them from bondage, and they return to
Zarahemla.
AND it came to pass that Amulon did gain favor in the eyes of the king of the Lamanites; therefore, the king of the Lamanites granted unto him and his brethren that they should be appointed teachers over his people, yea, even over the people who were in the land of Shemlon, and in the land of Shilom, and in the
“and of Amulon. 2 For the Lamanites
possession of all these lands; there- fore, the king of the Lamanites had appointed kings over all these lands.
3 And now the name of the king of the Lamanites was “Laman, being called after the name of his father; and therefore he was called king Laman. And he was king over a
numerous people.
4 And he appointed “teachers of the brethren of Amulon in every land which was possessed by his people; and thus the ‘language of Nephi began to be taught among all the people of the Lamanites.
5 And they were a people friendly | one with another; nevertheless they knew not God; neither did the brethren of Amulon teach them any- i} thing concerning the Lord their

God, neither the law of Moses; nor did they teach them the words of Abinadi;
6 But they taught them that they should keep their record, and that they might write one to another.
7 And thus the Lamanites began to increase in riches, and. began to “trade one with another and wax great, and began to be a cunning and a wise people, as to the wisdom of the world, yea, a very cunning people, delighting in all manner of wickedness and plunder, except it were among their own brethren.
8 And now it came to pass that “Amulon began to exercise “author- ity over Alma and his brethren, and began to persecute him, and cause that his children should persecute their children.
9 For Amulon knew Alma, that he had been “one of the king’s priests, and that it was he that believed the words of Abinadi and was driven out before the king, and therefore he was wroth with him; for he was subject to king Laman, yet he exercised authority over them, and put ’tasks upon them, and put ‘task- masters over them.
10 And it came to pass that so great were their afflictions that they began to cry mightily to God.
11 And Amulon commanded them that they should stop their cries; and he “put guards over them to watch them, that whosoever should be found calling upon God should be put to death.
12 And Alma and his people did not raise their voices to the Lord their God, but did pour out their “hearts to him; and he did know the >thoughts of their hearts.
13 And it “came to pass that the voice of the Lord came to them in their afflictions, ‘saying: Lift up

14 And I will also ease the “bur- dens which are put upon your shoulders, that even you cannot feel them upon your backs, even while you are in bondage; and this will I do that ye may stand as witnesses for me hereafter, and that ye may know of a surety that I, the Lord God, do visit my people in their “afflictions.
15 And now it came to pass that the burdens which were laid upon Alma and his brethren were made light; yea, the Lord did “strengthen them that they could bear up their *burdens with ease, and they did submit cheerfully and with ‘patience to all the will of the Lord.
16 And it came to pass that so great was. their faith and their patience that the voice of the Lord came unto them again, saying: Be of good comfort, for on the morrow I will deliver you out of bondage.
17 And he said unto Alma: Thou shalt go before this people, and I will go “with thee and deliver this people out of "bondage.
18 Now it came to pass that Alma and his people in the night-time gathered their flocks together, and also of their grain; yea, even all the night-time were they gathering their flocks together.
19 And in the morning the Lord caused a “deep sleep to come upon the Lamanites, yea, and all their task-masters were in a profound sleep.
20 And Alma and his people de- parted into the wilderness; and when they had traveled all day they pitched their tents in a valley, and
194 |
they called the valley Alma, be- | cause he led their way in the wilderness.
21 Yea, and in the valley of Alma they poured out their “thanks to | God because he had been merciful _ unto them, and eased their "burdens, and had delivered them out of bondage; for they were in bondage, and none could deliver them except — it were the Lord their God.
22 And they gave “thanks to God, | yea, all their men and all their women and all their children that could speak lifted their voices in the praises of their God.
23 And now the Lord said unto Alma: Haste thee and get thou and this people out of this land, for the Lamanites have awakened and do pursue thee; therefore get thee out of this land, and I will stop the Lamanites in this valley that they come no further in pursuit of this people.
24 And it came to pass that they departed out of the valley, and took their journey into the wilderness.
25 And after they had been in the wilderness “twelve days *they ar- rived in the land of Zarahemla; and king Mosiah did also "receive them with joy.
CHAPTER 25
The people (the Mulekites) of Zara- hemla become Nephites—They learn of the people of Alma and of Zeniff— | Alma baptizes Limhi and all his people—Mosiah authorizes Alma to organize the Church of God.
AND now king Mosiah caused that all the people should be gathered together.

Nephi, as there were of the “people ' of Zarahemla, who was a descen-
| dant of "Mulek, and those who came
with him into the wilderness.
3 And there were not so many of the people of Nephiand ofthe people - Of Zarahemla as there were of the Lamanites; yea, they were not half so numerous.
4 And now all the people of Nephi ' were assembled together, and also | all the people of Zarahemla, and
| they were gathered together in two
1} bodies.
_ 5 And it came to pass that Mosiah | did read, and caused to be read, the | records of Zeniff to his people; yea,
| he read the records of the people
of Zeniff, from the time they “left the land of Zarahemla until they
)| returned again.
_.6 And he also read the account of
sf Alma and his brethren, and all their
() afflictions, from the time they left *| the land of Zarahemla until the time | they returned again.
7 And now, when Mosiah had made an end of reading the records, his people who tarried in the land were struck with wonder and amaze- ment.
8 For they knew not what to think; for when they beheld those that had been delivered “out of bondage they were filled with exceedingly great
Joy. -9 And again, when they thought
"\ of their brethren who had been ') “slain by the Lamanites they were | filled with sorrow, and even shed
many tears of sorrow.
~10 And again, when they thought | of the immediate goodness of God, and his power in delivering Alma | and his brethren out of the hands of the Lamanites and of “bondage, they did raise their voices and give thanks to God.

11 And again, when they thought upon the Lamanites, who were their brethren, of their sinful and “pol- luted state, they were filled with *pain and anguish for the ‘welfare of their souls.
12 And it came to pass that those who “were the children of Amulon and his brethren, who had taken to wife the "daughters of the Laman- ites, were displeased with the con- duct of their fathers, and they would no longer be called by the names of their fathers, therefore they took upon» themselves the name of Nephi, that they might be called the children of Nephi and be numbered among those who were ‘called Nephites.
13 And now all the people of Zarahemla were “numbered with the Nephites, and this because the kingdom had been conferred upon none but those who were descen- dants of Nephi.
14 And now it came to pass that when Mosiah had made an end of speaking and reading to the people, he desired that Alma should also speak to the people.
15 And Alma did speak unto them, when they were assembled together in large bodies, and he went from one body to another, preaching unto the people repentance and faith on the Lord.
16 And he did exhort the people of Limhi and his brethren, all those that had been delivered out of bond- age, that they should remember that it was the Lord that did deliver them.
17 And it came to pass that after Alma had taught the people many things, and had made an end of speaking to them, that king Limhi was desirous that he might be bap- tized; and all his people were

desirous that they might be bap- tized also.
18 Therefore, Alma did go forth into the water and did “baptize them; yea, he did baptize them after the manner he did his brethren in the ’waters of Mormon; yea, and as many as he did baptize did belong to the church of God; and this because of their belief on the words of Alma.
19 And it came to pass that king Mosiah granted unto Alma that he might establish “churches through- out all the land of Zarahemla; and gave him power to "ordain ‘priests and “teachers over every church.
20 Now this was done because there were so many people that they could not all be governed by one teacher; neither could they all hear the word of God in one assembly ;
21 Therefore they did “assemble themselves. together in different bodies, being called churches; every church having their priests and their teachers, and every priest preaching the word according as it was delivered to him by the mouth of Alma.
22 And thus, notwithstanding there being many churches they were all one “church, yea, even the church of God; for there was noth- ing preached in all the churches except it were repentance and faith in God.
23 And now there were seven churches in the land of Zarahemla. And it came to pass that whosoever were desirous to take upon them the “name of Christ, or of God, they did join the churches of God;
24 And they were called the "people of God. And the Lord did pour out his ’Spirit upon them, and

CHAPTER 26
Many members of the Church are led | into sin by wunbelievers—Alma_ is'| promised eternal life—Those who| repent and are baptized gain forgive- | ness—Church members in sin who || repent and confess to Alma and to the | Lord shall be forgiven ; otherwise they || shall be excommunicated. |
Now it came to pass that there || were many of the rising generation || that could not understand the} “words of king Benjamin, being little :| children at the time he spake unto || his people; and they did “not believe » the tradition of their fathers.
2 They did not believe what had | been said concerning the resurrec- | tion of the dead, neither did they; believe concerning the coming of’ Christ.
3 And now because of their “un-- belief they could not °understand | the word of God; and their hearts} were hardened.
4 And they would not be baptized; ; neither would they join the “church. | And they were a separate people as; to their faith, and remained so ever ° after, even in their °carnal and sin-- ful state; for they would not call| upon the Lord their God.
5 And now in the reign of Mosiah | they were not half so numerous as; the people of God; but because of! the “dissensions among the brethren | they became more numerous.
6 For it came to pass that they did “deceive many with their “flattering; words, who were in the church, and! did cause them to commit many sins; therefore it became expedient

that those who committed sin, that were in the church, should be ‘admonished by the church.
7 And it came to pass that they were brought before the priests, and delivered up unto the “priests by the teachers; and the priests brought them before Alma, who was. the "high priest.
8 Now king Mosiah had. given Alma the ‘authority. over the ’church.
9 And it came.to pass that Alma did not know concerning them; but there were many “witnesses against them; yea, the people stood and testified of their iniquity in abun- dance.
10 Now there had not any such thing happened before in. the church; therefore Almawas troubled in his spirit, and he caused that they should be brought before the king.
11 And he said unto the king: Behold, here are many whom we have brought before thee, who are accused of their brethren; yea, and they. have been taken in divers iniquities. And they. do not repent of their iniquities; therefore we have brought them before thee, that-thou mayest judge them according to their crimes.
12 But king Mosiah said unto
i} Alma: Behold, I judge them not;
therefore I “deliver them into thy hands to be judged.
13 And now the spirit of Alma was again troubled; and he went and
inquired of the Lord what he should
do concerning this matter, for he
“f feared that he should do wrong in
it} the sight of God.

14 And it came to pass that after
MOSIAH 26:7-23
he had poured out his whole soul to God, the “voice of the Lord came to him, saying:
15 Blessed art thou, Alma, and blessed are they who were baptized in the “waters of Mormon. Thou art blessed because of thy exceeding ‘faith in the words alone of my servant Abinadi.
16 And blessed are they because of their exceeding faith in the words alone which thou hast spoken unto them.
17 And blessed art thou because thou hast established a “church among this. people; and they shall be established, and they shall be my people.
18 Yea, blessed is this people who are willing to bear my “name; for in my ’name shall they be called; and they are mine.
19. And because thou hast inquired of me concerning the transgressor, thou art blessed.
20 Thou art my servant; and I covenant with thee that thou shalt have “eternal life; and thou shalt serve me and go forth in my name, and shalt gather together my sheep.
21 And he that will hear my voice shall be my “sheep; and him shall ye receive into the church, and him will I also receive.
22 For behold, “this is my church; whosoever is ‘baptized: shall be baptized’ unto repentance. And whomsoever ye receive shall “believe in my name; and him will I freely “forgive.

24 For behold, in my name are they called; and if they “know me they shall come forth, and shall have a place eternally at my right hand.
25 And it shall come to pass that when the “second trump shall sound then shall they that never "knew me come forth and shallstand beforeme.
26 And then shall they know that I am the Lord their God, that I am their Redeemer; but they would not be redeemed.
27 And then I will confess unto them that I never “knew them; and they shall ’depart into ‘everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels.
28 Therefore I say unto you, that he that will not “hear my voice, the same shall ye not receive into my church, for him I will not receive at the last day.
29 Therefore I say- unto you, Go; and whosoever transgresseth against me, him. shall ye “judge “according to the sins which he has committed; and if he ‘confess his sins before thee and, me, and “repenteth in the sin- cerity of his heart, him shall ye ‘forgive, and I will forgive him also.
30° Yea, and “as often as my people ’repent will I forgive them their trespasses against me.
31 And ye shall also “forgive one another your trespasses; for verily Isay unto you, he that forgiveth not his °neighbor’s trespasses when he says that he repents, the same hath brought himself under condemna- tion.

32 Now I say unto you, Go; and whosoever will “not repent of his sins the same shall not be numbered _ | among my people; and this shall be _ | observed from this time forward.
33 And it came to pass when Alma | had heard these words he “wrote | them down that he might have them, and that he might judge the | people of that church according to | the commandments of God.
34 And it came to pass that Alma went and judged those that had been taken in iniquity, according to the *word of the Lord.
35 And whosoever repented of their sins and did “confess them, them he did number among the people of the church;
36 And those that would not con- | fess their sins and repent of their | iniquity, the same were not num- bered among the people of the church, and their names were “blotted out.
37 And it came to pass that Alma did regulate all the affairs of the church; and they began again to have peace and to prosper exceed- ingly in the affairs of the church, walking circumspectly before God, receiving many, and _ baptizing many.
38 And now all these things did Alma and his “fellow laborers do who were over the church, °walking in all diligence, teaching the word | of God in all things, suffering all manner of afflictions, being perse- cuted by all those who did not belong to the church of God.

AND now it came to pass that the persecutions ‘which were inflicted on the church by the unbelievers became so great that the church began to murmur, and complain to their leaders concerning the matter; and they did complain to Alma. And Alma laid the case before their king, Mosiah. And Mosiah °con- sulted with his priests.
2 And it came to pass that king Mosiah sent a proclamation through- out the land round about that there should not any unbeliever “perse- cute any of those who belonged to the church of God.
3 And there was a strict command throughout all the churches that there should be no “persecutions among them, that there should be an "equality among all men;
4 That they should let no pride nor haughtiness disturb their *peace; that every man should ’esteem his

‘neighbor as himself, “laboring with their own hands for their support.
5 Yea,»and all their priests and teachers “should "labor with their own hands for their support, in all Cases Save it were in sickness, or in much want; and doing these things, they did abound in the ‘grace of God.
6 And there began to be much peace again in the land; and the people began to be very numerous, and began to scatter abroad upon the face of the earth, yea, on the north and on the south, on the east and: on the west, building large cities and villages in all quarters of the land.
7 And the Lord did “visit them and >prosper them, and they became a large and wealthy people.
8 Now the sons of Mosiah were numbered among the “unbelievers; and also one of the sons of Alma was numbered among them, he being called Alma, after his father; never- theless, he became a very wicked and an *idolatrous man. And he was aman of many words, and did speak much ‘flattery to the people; there- fore he “led many of the people to do after the manner of his “iniquities.
9 And he became a great hinder- ment to the prosperity of the church of God; “stealing away the hearts of the people; causing much dissension among the people; giving a chance for the enemy of God to exercise his >power over them.
10 And now it came to pass that while he was going about to “destroy the church of God, for he did go about secretly with the sons of Mo- siah seeking to destroy the church,

and to lead astray the people of the Lord, contrary to the command- ments of God, or even the king—
11 And as I said unto you, as they were going about “rebelling against God, behold, the "angel of the Lord ‘appeared unto them; and he de- scended as it were in a “cloud; and he spake as it were with a voice: of thunder, which caused the earth to shake upon which they stood;
12 And so great was their astonish- ment, that they fell to the earth, and understood not the words which he spake unto them.
13. Nevertheless he cried again, saying: Alma, arise and stand forth, for why persecutest thou the church of God? For the Lord hath said: “This is my church, and I will estab- lish it; and nothing shall °overthrow it, save it is the transgression of my people.
14 And again, the angel said: Behold, the Lord hath “heard the prayers of his people, and also the °prayers of his servant, Alma, who is thy father ; for he has ‘prayed with much faith concerning thee that thou mightest be brought to the “knowledge of the truth; therefore, for this purpose have I come to ‘convince thee of the power and authority of God, that the ‘prayers of his servants might be answered according to their faith.
15 And now behold, can ye. dis- pute the power of God? For behold, doth not my voice shake the earth? And can ye not also “behold me before you? And I am sent from God.
16 Now I say unto thee: Go, and
200 | remember the captivity of thy |
fathers in the land of *Helam, and ||} in the land ot Nephi; and remember |}
how great things he has done for them; for they were in °bondage, | and he has “delivered them. And now I say unto thee, Alma, go thy way, and seek to destroy the church | no more, that their prayers may be | answered, and this even if thou wilt | of “thyself be cast off.
17 And now it came to pass that | these were the last words which the | angel spake unto Alma, and he | departed.
18 And now Alma and those that | were with him fell again to the earth, | for great was their astonishment; | for with their own eyes they had | beheld an “angel of the Lord; and his voice was as thunder, which | *’shook the earth; and they knew | that there was nothing save the power of God that could shake the earth and cause it to tremble as though it would part asunder.
19 And now the astonishment of Alma was so great that he became “dumb, that he could not open his mouth; yea, and he became weak, even that he could not move his hands; therefore he was taken by those that were with him, and car- ried helpless, even until he was laid before his father.
20 And they rehearsed unto. his father all that had happened unto |} them; and: his father rejoiced, for | he Knew that it was the power of God. |
21 And he caused that a multitude should be gathered together that they might witness what the Lord

had done for his son, and also for those that were with him.
22 And he caused that the priests
should assemble ‘themselves to- gether; and they began-to fast, and to pray to the Lord their God that he would open the mouth of Alma, that he might speak, and also that his limbs might receive their strength— that the eyes of the people might be opened to see and know of the goodness and glory of God. -23 And it came to pass after they had fasted and prayed for the space of “two days and two nights, the limbs.) of Alma ‘received their strength, and he stood up and began to speak unto them, bidding them to be of good comfort:
24 For, said he, I have repented of my sins, and have been “redeemed of the Lord; behold I am born of the Spirit.
25 And the Lord said unto me: | Marvel not that all mankind, yea,
‘| men and women, all nations, kin-
dreds, tongues and people, must be | *born again; yea, “born of God, ‘changed’ from their carnal and 4fallen state, to a state of righ- teousness, being redeemed of God, becoming his ‘sons and daughters ;
26 And thus they become new | creatures; and unless they do this, they can in “nowise inherit the | kingdom of God.
27 I say unto you, unless this be the case, they must be cast off; and | this I know, because I was like to
be cast off. | 28 Nevertheless, after “wading through much °tribulation, repent- | ing nigh unto death, the Lord in

mercy hath seen fit to snatch me out of an ‘everlasting burning, and Iam born of God.
29 My soul hath been “redeemed from the gall of bitterness and >bonds of iniquity. I was in the dark- est abyss; but now I behold the marvelous light of God. My soul was ‘racked with eternal torment; but I am ¢snatched, and my soul is ‘pained no more.
30 I rejected my Redeemer, and denied that which had been spoken of by our fathers ; but now that they may foresee that he will come, and that he remembereth every creature of his creating, he will make himself manifest unto Zall.
31 Yea, “every knee shall bow, and every tongue confess before him. Yea, even at the last day, when all men shall stand to be °judged of him, then shall they confess that he is *God; then shall they confess, who live ‘without God in the world, that the judgment of an everlasting punishment is just upon them; and they shall quake, and tremble, and shrink beneath the glance of his “all-searching eye.
32 And now it came to pass that Alma began from this time forward to teach the people, and those who were with Alma at the time the angel appeared unto them, travel- ing round about through all the land, publishing to all the people the things which. they had. heard and seen, and preaching the word of God in much tribulation, being greatly persecuted by those who were unbelievers, being smitten by many of them.

33 But notwithstanding all this, they did impart much consolation to the church, confirming their faith, and exhorting them with long- suffering and much travail to keep the commandments of God.
34 And four of them were the “sons
of Mosiah; and their names were |
Ammon, and Aaron, and Omner, and Himni; these were the names of the sons of Mosiah.
35 And they traveled throughout all the land of Zarahemla, and among all the “people who were under the reign of king Mosiah, *zealously striving to repair all the injuries which they had done to the church, ‘confessing all their sins, and publishing all the things which they had_-seen, and explaining the prophecies and the scriptures to all who desired to hear them.
36 And thus they were instruments in the hands of God in bringing many to the knowledge of the truth, yea, to the knowledge of their Redeemer.
37 And how blessed are they ! For they did “publish peace; they did publish good tidings of good; and they did declare unto the people that the Lord reigneth.

The sons of Mosiah shall have eternal life—They go to preach to the Laman- ites—Mosiah translates the Jaredite plates with the two seer stones.

that they might, with these whom
they had "selected, go up to the land | of ‘Nephi that they might preach
the things which they had heard,
and that they might impart the word of God to their brethren, the
Lamanites—
2 *That perhaps they might bring them to the knowledge of the Lord their God, and convince them of the iniquity of their fathers; and that perhaps they might cure them of their "hatred towards the Nephites, that they might also be brought to rejoice in the Lord their God, that they might become friendly to one another, and that there should, be no more contentions in all the land which the Lord their God had given them.
3.Now they were desirous that salvation should be declared to every creature, for they could not *bear that any human ’soul should ‘perish; yea, even the very thoughts that any soul should endure “end- less torment did cause them to quake and ‘tremble.
4 And thus did the Spirit of the Lord work upon them, for they were the very “vilest of sinners. And the Lord saw fit in his infinite "mercy to spare them; nevertheless they suf- fered much anguish of soul because of their iniquities, suffering much and fearing that they should be cast off forever.
5 And it came to pass that thee | did plead with their father many | days that they might go up to the | land of Nephi.
6 And king Mosiah went and) *inquired of the Lord if he should let his sons go up among the Lamanites

9 And they “took their journey into the wilderness to go up to preach the word among the Lamanites; and I shall give an ’account of their proceedings hereafter.
10 Now king Mosiah had no one to confer the kingdom upon, for there was not any of his sons who “would accept of the kingdom.
11 Therefore he took the records _ which were engraven on the plates | of “brass, and also the plates of | Nephi, and all the things which he had: kept and preserved according to the commandments of God, after having translated and caused to be written the records which were on the ‘plates of gold which had been _ found by the people of Limhi, which were delivered to him-by the hand of Limhi;
12 And this he did because'of the great anxiety of his people; for they | were desirous beyond measure to know concerning those people ¢who had been destroyed.
13 And now he translated them
| by the means of those two “stones
which were fastened into. the two tims of a bow.
14 Now these things were pre- | pared from the beginning, and were handed down from generation to generation, for the purpose of inter-

16 And whosoever has these things is called “seer, after the manner of old times.
17 Now after Mosiah had finished “translating these °records, behold, it gave an account of the people who were ‘destroyed, from the time that they were destroyed back to the building of the “great tower, at the_time the Lord *confounded the language of the people and they were scattered abroad upon the face of all the earth, yea, and even from that time back until the creation of Adam.
18 Now this account did cause the people of Mosiah to mourn exceed- ingly, yea, they were filled with sorrow; nevertheless it gave them much knowledge, in the which they did rejoice.
19 And this account shall be ¢writ- ten hereafter; for behold, it is expedient that all people should know the things which are written in this account.

CHAPTER . 29
Mosiah proposes that judges be chosen in place of a king—Unrighteous kings lead their people into sin—Alma the younger is chosen chief judge by the voice of the people—He is also the high priest over the Church—Alma the elder and Mosiah die.
Now when Mosiah had done this he sent out throughout all the land, among all the people, desiring to know their will concerning who should be their king.
2 And it came to pass that the voice of the people came, saying: We are desirous that Aaron thy son should be our king and our ruler.
3 Now Aaron had gone up to the land of Nephi, therefore the king could not confer the kingdom upon him; “neither would Aaron take upon him the kingdom; neither were any of the ’sons of Mosiah ‘willing to take upon them the kingdom.
4 Therefore king Mosiah sent again among the people; yea, even a written word sent he among the people. And these were the words that were written, saying:
5 Behold, O ye my people, or my brethren, for I esteem you as such, I desire that ye should consider the cause which ye are called to “con- sider—for ye are desirous to have a king. )
6 Now I declare unto you that he to whom the kingdom doth rightly belong has declined, and will not take upon him the kingdom.

tentions among you. “And who knoweth but what my son, to whom | the ‘kingdom doth belong, should | turn to be angry and "draw away a part of this people after him, which | would cause wars and contentions among you, which would be the cause of shedding much blood and perverting the way of the Lord, yea, and destroy the souls of many people.
8 Now I say unto you let us be wise and consider these things, for we have no right to destroy my son, neither should we have any right to destroy another if he should be appointed in his stead.
9 And if my son should turn again to his pride and vain things he would recall the things which he had said, and claim his right to the kingdom, which would cause him and also this people to commit much sin.
10 And now let us be wise and look forward to these things, and do that which will make for the peace of this people.
11 Therefore I will be your king the remainder of my days; neverthe- less, let °us appoint ’judges, to judge this. people according to our law; and we will newly arrange the affairs | of this people, for we will appoint wise men to be judges, that will judge this people according to the commandments of God.
12 Now it is better that a man | should be “judged of God than of ! man, for the judgments of God are always just, but the judgments of ' man are not always just.

kings who would do even as my father “Benjamin did for this people—I say unto you, if this could always be the case. then it would be expedient that ye should always have'kings to rule over you.
14 And even I myself have labored with all the power and faculties which I have possessed, to teach you the commandments of God, and to establish peace throughout the land, that there should be no. wars nor contentions, no stealing, nor plundering, nor murdering, nor any manner of iniquity ;
15 And whosoever has committed iniquity, him have I “punished according to the crime which he has committed, according to the law which has been given to us by our fathers.
16 Now I say unto you, that be- cause all men are not just it is not expedient that ye should have a *king or kings to rule over you. -
17 For behold, how much “iniquity doth one wicked king cause to be committed, yea, and what great destruction !
18 Yea, remember king Noah, his *wickedness and his abominations, and also the wickedness and abom- inations of his people. Behold what great destruction did come upon them; and also because of their iniquities they were brought into >bondage.
19 And were it not for the inter- position of their all-wise Creator, and this because of their sincere repentance, they must unavoidably remain in bondage until now.
20 But behold, he did deliver them because they did “humble them-

21 And behold, now I say unto you, ye cannot dethrone an iniqui- tous “king save it be through much contention, and the shedding of much blood.
22 For behold, he has his “friends in iniquity, and he keepeth his guards about him; and he teareth up the laws of those who have reigned in righteousness before him; and he trampleth under his feet the com- mandments of God;
23 And. he enacteth laws, and sendeth them forth among_ his people, yea, laws after the manner of his own wickedness; and who- soever doth not obey his laws he *causeth to be destroyed; and who- soever doth rebel against him he will send his armies against them to war, and if he can he will destroy them; and thus an unrighteous king doth pervert the ways of all righteousness.
24 And now behold I say unto you, it is not expedient that such abom- inations should come upon you.
25 Therefore, choose you by the ¢voice of this people, judges, that ye may. be °judged according to the ‘laws which have been given you by our fathers, which are correct, and which were given them by the hand of the Lord.

thing ’contrary to that which is right; but it is common for the lesser part of the ‘people to desire that which is not right; therefore this shall ye observe and make it your law—to do your business by the voice of the people.
27 And “if the time comes that the voice of the people doth choose iniquity, then is the time that the judgments of God will come upon you; yea, then is the time he will visit you with great destruction even as he has hitherto visited this land.
28 And now if ye have judges, and they do not “judge you according to the law which has been given, ye can cause that they may be judged of a higher judge.
29 If your higher judges do not judge righteous judgments, ye shall cause that a small number of your lower judges should be gathered to- gether, and they shall judge your higher judges, according to the voice of the people.
30 And I command you to do these things in the fear of the Lord; and I command you to do these things, and that ye have no king; that if these people commit sins and iniqui- ties they shall be answered upon their own heads.
31 For behold I say unto you, the sins of many people have been %caused by the iniquities of their kings; therefore their iniquities are answered upon the heads of their kings.

33 And many more things did king | Mosiah write unto them, unfolding | unto them all the trials and “troubles | of a righteous king, yea, all the | travails of soul for their people, and | also all the murmurings of the | people to their king; and he explained it all unto them.
34 And he told them that these | things ought not to be; but that the burden should come upon all the | people, that every man might “bear | his part.
35 And he also unfolded unto them | all the disadvantages they labored under, by having an unrighteous “king to rule over them;

37 And now it came to pass, after king Mosiah had sent these things forth among the people they were > “convinced of the truth of his words. |
38 Therefore they relinquished their desires for a king, and became | exceedingly anxious that every man should have an equal “chance throughout all the land; yea, and every man expressed a willingness to answer for his own sins.

to judge them according to the ‘law which had been given them; and they were exceedingly © rejoiced because of the “liberty which had been granted unto then
40 And they did wax strong in love towards Mosiah; yea, they did esteem him more than any other man; for they did not look upon him as a “tyrant who was seeking for gain, yea, for that “lucre which doth ‘corrupt the soul; for he had not exacted riches of them, neither had he delighted in the shedding of blood; but he had established “peace in the land, and he had granted unto his people that they should be delivered from all manner of bond- age; therefore they did esteem him, yea, exceedingly, beyond measure.
41 And it came to pass that they did “appoint "judges to rule over them, or to judge them according to the law; and this they did throughout all the land. _ 42 And it came to pass that Alma
was appointed to be the first “chief judge, he being also the "high priest, his father having conferred the office

upon him, and having given him the charge concerning all the affairs of the church.
43 And now it came to pass that Alma did “walk in the ways of the Lord, and he did keep his com- mandments, and he did judge righteous judgments; and there was continual peace through the land.
44 And thus *commenced the “reign of the judges throughout all the land of Zarahemla, among all the people who were called the Nephites; and Alma was the first and chief judge.
45 And now it came to pass that his father died, being eighty and two years old, having lived to fulfil the commandments of God.
46 And it’ came to pass that Mosiah “died also, in the thirty and third year of his reign, being "sixty and three years old; making in the whole, five hundred and nine years from the time Lehi left Jerusalem.
47 And thus ended the reign of the kings over the people of Nephi; and thus ended the days of Alma, who was the founder of their church.

OW it came to pass that in N the first year of the reign of
the judges over the people of Nephi, from this time forward, king Mosiah having “gone the way of all the earth, having warred a good war- fare, walking uprightly before God, leaving none to reign in his stead; nevertheless he had. established blaws, and they were acknowledged by the people; therefore they were obliged to abide by the ‘laws which he had made.
2 And it came to pass that in the first year of the reign of Alma in the judgment-seat, there was a “man brought before him to be judged, a man who was large, and was noted for his much strength.
3 And he had gone about among the people, preaching to them that which he “termed to be the word of God, bearing down °against the church; declaring unto the people that every priest and teacher ought to become ‘popular; and they ought 4not to labor with their hands, but that they ought to be supported by the people.
4 And he also testified unto the people that “all mankind should be saved at the last day, and that they ’need not fear nor tremble, but that they might lift up their heads and Tejoice; for the Lord had ‘created all men, and had also “redeemed “all men; and, in the end, all men should have eternal life.
5 And it came to pass that he did teach these things so much that many did believe on his words, even so many that they began to support him and give him “money.

6 And he began to be lifted up in | the pride of his heart; and to wear |} very costly “apparel, yea, and even | began to "establish a ‘church after | the manner of his preaching.
7 And it came to pass as he was | going, to preach to those whe | believed on his word, he met aman | who belonged to the church of God, | yea, even one of their “teachers; | and he. began to contend with him |} sharply, that he might lead away | the people of the church; but the man.withstood him, admonishing | him with the ’words of God.
8 Now the name of the man was | 2Gideon; and it was he who was an | instrument in the hands of God in delivering the people of Limhi out of bondage.
9: Now, because Gideon withstood | him with the words of God he was | wroth with Gideon, and drew~his sword and began to smite him. Now Gideon being “stricken with many years, therefore he was not able to withstand his blows, therefore he was slain by the sword.
10 And the man who slew him was taken by the people of the church, and was brought before Alma, to be "judged according to the crimes which he had committed.
11 And it came to pass that he stood before Alma and pleaded for himself with much boldness.
12 But Alma said unto him: Be- hold, this is the first time that) “priestcraft has been introduced among this people. And behold, thou art not only guilty of priest- craft, but hast endeavored to en- force it by the sword; and were

*priestcraft to be enforced among this people it would prove their entire destruction.
13 And thou hast shed-the “blood of a righteous man, yea, a man who has done much good among this people; and were we to spare thee his blood would come upon ts for >vengeance. 3
14 Therefore thou art condemned to *die, according to the "law which has been given us by Mosiah, our last king; and it has been ‘acknowl- edged by this people; therefore this people must “abide by the law.
15 And it came to pass that they took him; and his name was *“Nehor; and they carried him upon the top of the hill Manti, and there he was caused, or rather did acknowledge, between the heavens and the earth, that what he had taught to the people was contrary to the word of God; and there he suffered an ignominious °death.
16 Nevertheless, this did not put an end to the spreading of priest- craft through the land; for there were many who loved the vain things of the world, and they went forth preaching “false doctrines; and this they did for the sake of briches and honor.
17 Nevertheless, they durst not ie, if it were known, for fear of the law, for liars were punished ;'there- fore they pretended to preach according to their belief; and now the law could have no power on any man for °his belief. | 18 And they durst not “steal, for
fear of the law, for such were pun- ished; neither durst they rob, nor

murder, for he that “murdered was punished.unto ‘death.
19 But it came to pass that who- soever did not belong to the church of God began to persecute those that did belong to the church of God, and had taken upon them the name of Christ.
20 Yea, they did persecute them, and afflict them with all manner of words, and this because of their humility; because they were not proud in their own eyes, and because they did impart the word of God, one with another, without “money and without price.
21 Now there was a strict law among the people of the church, that there should “not any man, belong- ing to the church, arise and perse- cute those that did not belong to the church, and that there should be no persecution among themselves:
22 Nevertheless, there were many among them who began to be proud, and began to contend warmly with their adversaries, even unto blows; yea, they would smite one another with their “fists.
23 Now this was in the *second year of the reign of Alma, and it was a cause of much affliction to the church; yea, it was the cause of much trial with the church.
24 For the hearts of many were hardened, and their names were “blotted out, that they were remem- bered no more among the people of God. And also many withdrew themselves from among them.
25 Now this was a great trial to those that did stand fast in the faith; nevertheless, they were “steadfast

and immovable in keeping the com- mandments of God, and-they bore with patience the persecution which was heaped upon them.
26 And when the priests left. their "labor to impart the word of God unto the people, the people also left their labors to hear the word of God. And when the priest had imparted unto them the word of God they all returned again diligently unto their labors; and the priest, not esteem- ing himself above his hearers, for the preacher was no better than the hearer, neither was the teacher any better than the learner; and thus they were all equal, and they did all labor, every man ’according to his strength.
27 And they did “impart of their substance, every man according to that which he had, to the ’poor, and the needy, and: the sick, and the afflicted; and they. did not wear costly ‘apparel, yet they were neat and comely.
28 And thus they did establish the affairs of the church; and thus they began to have continual peace again, notwithstanding all their persecutions.
29 And now, because of the steadi- ness of the church they began to be exceedingly “rich, having abun- dance of all things whatsoever they stood in need—an abundance of flocks and herds, and fatlings) of every kind, and also abundance of grain, and of gold, and of silver, and of precious things, and abundance of 'silk and fine-twined linen, and all manner of good homely ‘cloth.
30 And thus, in their “prosperous

circumstances, they did not send | away any who were °naked, or that were hungry, or that were athirst, or that were sick, or that had not been nourished ; and they did not set their | hearts upon ‘riches; therefore they | were “liberal to all, both old and young, both bond and. free, both male and female, whether out of the church or in the church, having no | ‘respect to persons as to those who | stood in need. |
31. And thus they did “prosper and | become far more wealthy than those who did not belong to their church. |
32 For those who did not belong to | their church did indulge themselves in “sorceries, and in “idolatry or | ‘idleness, and in “babblings, and in “envyings and ‘strife; wearing costly || apparel; being ’lifted up in the pride of their own eyes; persecuting, lying, thieving, robbing, commit- | ting whoredoms, and murdering, and all manner of wickedness; nevertheless, the law was put in force upon all those who did trans- gress it, inasmuch as it was possible.
33 And it came to pass that by thus exercising the law upon them, every man. suffering according to that which. he had done, they became more still, and durst not commit any wickedness if it were known; there- fore, there was much peace among the people of Nephi until the fifth year of the reign of the judges.

make war on the Nephites and are defeated—The Lamanites and Amli- cites join forces and are defeated— Alma slays Amilici.
AND it came to pass in the com- mencement of the *fifth year of their reign there began to be a contention among the people; for a certain *man, being called Amlici, he being a very cunning man, yea, a wise man as to the wisdom of the world, he being after the order of the man that slew °Gideon by the sword, who was executed according to the law—
2 Now this Amlici had, by his cun- ning, “drawn away much people after him; even so much that they began to be very powerful; and they began to endeavor to establish Amlici to be a king over the people. ~3 Now this was alarming to the people of the church, and also to all those who had not been drawn away after the persuasions of Amilici; for they knew that accord- ing to their law that such things must be established by the “voice of the people.
4 Therefore, if it were possible that Amilici should gain the voice of the people, he, being a wicked man, would “deprive them of their rights and privileges of the church; for it was his intent to destroy the churchof God.
5 And it came to pass that the people assembled themselves to- gether throughout all the land, every man according to his mind, whether it were for or against Amlici, in separate bodies, having much dispute and wonderful “con- tentions one with another.
6 And thus they did ‘assemble themselves together to cast in their *voices concerning the matter; and | they were laid before the judges.

7 And it came to pass that the “voice of the people came against Amlici, that he was not made king over the people.
8 Now this did cause much joy in the hearts of those who were against him; but Amlici did stir up those who were in his favor to anger against those who were not in his favor.
9 And it came to pass that they gathered themselves together, and did “consecrate Amlici to be their king.
10 Now when Amlici was made king over them he commanded them that they should take up arms against their brethren; and this he did that he might subject them to him.
11 Now the people of Amlici were distinguished by the name of Amlici, being called “Amlicites; and the remainder were °called Ne- phites, or the people of God.
12 Therefore the people of the Nephites were aware of the intent of the Amlicites, and therefore they did prepare to meet them; yea, they did arm themselves with swords, and with cimeters, and with bows, and with arrows, and with stones, and with slings, and with all man- ner of “weapons of war, of every kind.
13 And thus they were prepared to meet the Amlicites at the time of their coming. And there were appointed “captains, and higher captains, and chief captains, accord- ing to their numbers.
14 And it came to pass that Amlici did arm his men with all manner of weapons of war of every kind; and he also appointed rulers and leaders over his people, to lead them to war against their brethren.
15 And it came to pass that the

ALMA 2:16-29
Amlicites. came upon the_ hill Amnihu, which. was east of the “river Sidon, which ran by the "land of Zarahemla, and there they began to make war with the Nephites.
16 Now Alma, being the “chief judge and the °governor of the people of Nephi, therefore he went up with his people, yea, with his captains, and chief captains, yea, at the head of his armies, against the Amlicites to battle.
17 And they began to slay the Amlicites upon the hill east of Sidon. And. the Amlicites did contend with the Nephites with great strength, insomuch that many of the Nephites did fall before the Amlicites.
18 Nevertheless the Lord did strengthen the hand of the Nephites, that they. slew the Amlicites with great slaughter, that they began to flee before them.
19 And it came to pass that the Nephites did pursue the Amlicites all that day,.and did slay them with much slaughter, insomuch that there were “slain of the Amlicites twelve thousand five hundred thirty and two souls; and there were slain of. the Nephites six thousand five hundred sixty and two souls.
20 And it came to pass that when Alma could pursue the Amlicites no longer he caused that his people should pitch their tents in the “valley of Gideon, the valley being called after that Gideon who was slain by the hand of ’Nehor with the sword; and in this valley the Nephites did pitch their tents for the night.
21 And Alma sent spies to follow the remnant of the Amlicites, that he might know. of their plans and their plots, whereby he might guard himself against them, that he might preserve his people from being destroyed.
212
22 Now those whom he had sent out to watch the camp of the Amilicites | were called Zeram, and Amnor, and | Manti, and Limher; these were they who went out with their men to watch the camp of the Amlicites.
23 And it came to pass that on the |f morrow they returned into the camp of the Nephites in great haste, being greatly astonished, and struck with much fear, saying:
24 Behold, we followed the “camp of the °Amlicites, and to our great astonishment, in the land of Minon, above the land of Zarahemla; in the course of the land of ‘Nephi, we saw a numerous host of the Lamanites; and. behold, the Amlicites have joined them;
25 And they are upon our breth- ren in that land; and they are fleeing before them with their flocks, and their wives, and their children, to- wards our city; and except we make haste they obtain possession of our city, and our fathers, and our wives, and our children be slain.
26.And it came to pass that the people of Nephi took their tents, and departed out of the valley of | Gideon. towards their “city, which was the city of °Zarahemla.
27.And behold, as they were cross- ing the river Sidon, the Lamanites and the Amlicites, being as *numer- ous almost, as it were, as the sands of the sea, came upon them to destroy them.
28 Nevertheless, the Nephites being “strengthened by- the hand of | the Lord, having prayed mightily to him that he would deliver them out of the hands of their enemies, therefore the Lord did hear their cries, and did strengthen them, and the Lamanites and the Amlicites did fall before them.
29 And it came to pass that Alma. fought with Amlici with the sword. .

face to face; and they did contend mightily, one with another.
30 And it came to pass that Alma, being a man of God, beifig exercised with much “faith, cried, saying: O Lord, have mercy and ’spare my life, that I may be an instrument in thy hands to save and preserve this people. g
31 Now when Alma had said these words he contended again with Amlici; and he was strengthened, insomuch that he slew Amlici with the sword.
32 And he also contended with the king of the Lamanites; but the king of the Lamanites fled back from before Alma and sent his guards to contend with Alma.
33 But Alma, with his guards, con- tended with the guards of the king of the Lamanites until he slew and drove them back.
34 And thus he cleared the ground, or rather the bank, which was on the west of the river Sidon, throwing the bodies of the Lamanites who had been slain into the waters of Sidon, that thereby his people might have room to cross and contend with the Lamanites and the Amlicites on the west side of the river Sidon.
35 And it came to pass that when they had all crossed the river Sidon that the Lamanites and the Amli- cites began to flee before them, not- withstanding they were so numerous that they could not be numbered.
36 And they fled before the Nephites towards the wilderness which was west and north, away beyond the borders of the land; and the Nephites did pursue them with their might, and did slay them.
37, Yea, they were met on every hand, andslain and: driven, ‘until they were scattered on the west, and onthe north, until they had reached the wilderness, which was called Hermounts; and it was that part of

the wilderness which was infested by wild and ravenous beasts.
38 And it came to pass that many died in the wilderness of their wounds, and were devoured by those beasts and also the vultures of the air; and their bones have been found, and have been heaped up on the earth.
CHAPTER 3
The Amlicites had marked themselves according to the prophetic word—The Lamanites had been cursed for their rebellion—Men bring their own curses upon themselves—The Nephites de- feat another Lamanite army.
AND it ‘came to pass that the Nephites who were not “slain by the weapons of war, after having buried those who had been slain—now the number of the slain were not num- bered, because of the greatness of their number—after they had fin- ished burying their dead they all returned to their lands, and to their houses, and their wives, and their children.
2 Now many women and children had been slain with the sword, and also many of their flocks and their herds; and alsomany oftheir fields of grain were destroyed, for they were trodden down by the hosts of men.
3 And now as many of the Laman- ites and the Amlicites who had been slain upon the bank of the river Sidon were cast into the “waters of Sidon; and behold their bones are in the depths of the ’sea, and: they aremany.
4 And the “Amlicites were dis- tinguished from the Nephites, for they had ’marked themselves with red in their foreheads after the man- ner of the Lamanites; nevertheless they had not shorn their heads like unto the Lamanites.
5 Now the heads of the Lamanites were shorn; and they were “naked,

[87 B.c.]
ALMA 3:6-19
save it were skin which was girded about their loins, and also their armor, which was girded about them, and their bows, and. their arrows, and their stones, and their slings, and so forth.
6 And the skins of the Lamanites were dark, according to the mark which was set upon their fathers, which was a “curse upon them be- cause of their transgression and their rebellion against their breth- ren, who consisted of Nephi, Jacob, and Joseph, and Sam, who were just and holy men.
7 And their brethren sought to destroy them, therefore they were cursed; and the Lord God set a “mark upon them, yea, upon Laman and Lemuel, and also the sons of Ishmael, and Ishmaelitish women.
8 And this was done that their seed might be distinguished from the seed of their brethren, that thereby the Lord God might preserve his people, that they might not *mix and believe in incorrect traditions which would prove their destruction.
9 And it came to pass that whoso- ever did mingle his seed with that of the Lamanites did bring the same curse upon his seed.
10 Therefore, whosoever suffered himself to be led away by the Lamanites was called under that head,. and there was a mark set upon him.
11 And it came to pass that who- soever would not believe in the “tradition of the Lamanites, but believed those records which were brought out of the land of Jeru- salem, and also in the tradition of their fathers, which were correct, who believed in the commandments of God and kept them, were °called the Nephites, or the people of Nephi, from that time forth—

12 And it is they who have kept | . the records which are “true of their | people, and also of the people of the Lamanites.
13 Now we will return again to the | Amlicites, for they also had a | ¢mark set upon them; yea, they set | the mark upon themselves, yea, | even a mark of red upon their fore- | heads.
14 Thus the word of God is ful- |} filled, for these are the words which |f he said to Nephi: Behold, the | Lamanites have I cursed, and I will |} set a mark on them that they and | their seed may be “separated from | thee and thy seed, from this time henceforth and forever, except they repent of their wickedness and || *turn to me that I may have mercy ff upon them.
15 And again: I will set a mark || upon him that mingleth his seed. with thy brethren, that they may” be cursed also.
16 And again: I will set a mark || upon him that fighteth against thee : and thy seed.
17 And again, I say he that: departeth from thee shall no more: be called thy seed; and I will bless ; thee, and whomsoever shall be: called thy seed, henceforth and. forever; and these were the prom-: ises of the Lord unto Nephi and to } his seed.
18 Now the Amlicites knew not: that they were fulfilling the words jj of God when they began to mark | themselves in their foreheads; ; nevertheless they had come out in| open “rebellion against God; there- : fore it was expedient that the curse : should fall upon them.
19 Now I would that ye should | see that they: brought upon them- : selves the “curse; and even so. doth | every man that is cursed bring}

upon. himself his own condemna- tion.
20 Now it came to pass that not many days after the battle which was fought in the land of Zara- hemla, by the Lamanites and the Amlicites, that there was another army of the Lamanites came in upon the people of Nephi, in the “same place where the first army met the Amlicites.
21 And it came:to pass that there | Was an army sent to drive them out of their land.
22 Now Alma _ himself» being afflicted with a ?wound did not go up to battle at this time against the Lamanites;
23 But he sent up a numerous army against them; and they went up and slew many of the Laman- ites, and drove the remainder of them out of the borders of their land.
24 And then they returned again and began to establish peace in the land, being troubled no more for a time with their enemies.
25 Now all these things were done, yea, all these wars and con- tentions -were commenced and ended in the *fifth year of the reign of the judges.
26 And in one year were thousands and tens of thousands of souls sent to the eternal world, that. they might reap their “rewards according to their works, whether they were good or whether they were bad, to reap eternal happiness or eternal misery; according to the «spirit which they listed to obey, whether it be a good spirit or a bad one.

CHAPTER 4
Alma. baptizes thousands of converis —lIniquity enters the Church, and the Church’s progress is hindered— Nephihah is appointed chief judge— Alma, as high priest, devotes himself to the ministry.
Now it came to pass in the fsixth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi, there were no contentions nor wars in the “land of Zarahemla;
2 But the people were afflicted, yea, greatly afflicted for the loss of their brethren, and also for the “loss of their flocks and herds, and also for the loss of their fields of grain, which were trodden under foot and destroyed by the Lamanites.
3 And so great were their afflic- tions that every soul had cause to mourn; and they believed that it was the judgments of God sent upon them because of their wicked- ness and their abominations; there- fore they were “awakened to a remembrance of their duty.
4 And they began to establish the *church more fully; yea, and many were "baptized in the ‘waters of Sidon and were joined to the church of God; yea, they were baptized by the hand of Alma, who had been consecrated the “high priest over the people of the church, by the hand of his father Alma.
5 And it came to pass in the tseventh year of the reign of the judges there were about three thousand five hundred souls that united themselves to the “church of God and were baptized. And thus ended the seventh year of the reign of the judges over the people

of Nephi; and there was continual peace in all that time.
6 And it came to pass in the *eighth year of the reign of the judges, that the people of the church began to wax proud, be- cause of their exceeding ?riches, and their “fine silks, and their fine- twined linen, and because of their many flocks and herds, and their gold and their silver, and all manner of precious things, which they had obtained by their ‘industry; and in all these things were they lifted up in the pride of their eyes, for they began to wear very costly “apparel.
7 Now this was the cause of much affliction to Alma, yea, and to many of the people whom Alma had consecrated to be “teachers, and *priests,, and ‘elders over the church; yea, many of them were sorely grieved for the wickedness which they saw had begun to be among their people.
8 For they saw and beheld with great sorrow that the people of the church began to be lifted up in the pride of their eyes, and to set their “hearts upon. riches and upon the vain things of the world, that they began. to be scornful, one towards another, and they began to perse- cute those that did °’not believe according to their own will and pleasure.
9 And thus, in this eighth year of the reign of the judges, there began to be great “contentions among the people of the church; yea, there were °envyings, and ‘strife, and malice, and persecutions, and pride, even to exceed the pride of those whe did not belong to the church of God.
216 |
10 And thus ended the eighth year |} of the reign of the judges; and the |} wickedness of the church was a | great “¢stumbling-block to those | who did not belong to the church; | and thus the church began to fail in | its progress.
11 And it came to pass in the |} tcommencement of the ninth year, | Alma saw the wickedness of the | church, and he saw also that the | %example of the church began to) lead those who were unbelievers on from one piece of iniquity to another, thus bringing on the destruction of the people.
12 Yea, he saw great inequality | among the people, some lifting themselves up with their pride, | despising others, turning their | backs upon the “needy and the | naked and those who were "hungry, | and those who were athirst, and those who were sick and afflicted.
13 Now this was a great cause for | lamentations among the people, | while others were abasing them- | selves, succoring those who stood in need of their succor, such as imparting their substance to the "poor and the needy, feeding the hungry, and suffering all manner of ' rafflictions, for Christ’s ‘sake, who should come according to the spirit of prophecy ;
14 Looking forward to that day, | thus “retaining a ’remission of their | sins; being filled with great ‘joy be- || cause of the resurrection of the dead, || according to the will and power and 4deliverance of Jesus Christ from the bands of death.

the persecutions which were heaped upon them by the remainder of his people, and seeing all their “in- equality, began to be very sorrow- ful; nevertheless the Spirit of the Lord did not fail him.
16 And he selected a wise man who was among the “elders~ of the church, and gave’ him power according to the voice of the /people, that he might have power to enact ‘laws according to the laws which had been given, and to put them in = force according to the wickedness and the crimes of the people.
17 Now this man’s name ‘was *Nephihah, and he was appointed *chief judge; and he sat in the judgment-seat to judge and to govern the people.
18 Now Alma did not grant unto him the office of being “high priest over the church, but he retained the office of high priest unto himself; but he delivered the judgment-seat unto ’Nephihah. —
19 And this he did that he *him- self might go forth among his people, or among the people of Nephi, that he might preach the ‘word of God unto them, to ¢stir them up in ‘remembrance of their duty, and that he might pull down, by the word of God, all the pride and craftiness and all the. con- tentions which were among his people, seeing no way that he might reclaim them save it were in bearing down in pure ‘testimony against them.
20 And thus in the commencement of the ninth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi,

The words which Alma, the High Priest according to the holy order of God, delivered to the people in their cities and villages throughout the land. Comprising chapter 5.
CHAPTER 5
To gain salvation, men must repent and keep the commandments, be born again, cleanse their garments through the blood. of Christ, be humble and strip themselves from pride and envy, and do the works of righteousness— The Good Shepherd calleth his people —Those who do evil works are children of the devil—Alma testifies of the truth of his doctrine and com- mands men to repent—Names of the righteous shall be written in the book of life.
Now it came to pass that *Alma began to “deliver the word of "God unto the people, first in the land of Zarahemla, and from thence throughout all the land.
2 And these are the words which he spake to the people in the church which was established in the city of Zarahemla, according to his own record, saying:

establish a church in the 4land which was in the borders of Nephi; yea, the land which was called the land of Mormon; yea, and he did baptize his brethren in the waters of Mormon.
4 And behold, I say unto you, they were “delivered out of the hands of the people of king Noah, by the mercy and power of God.
5 And.behold, after that, they were brought into “bondage by the hands of the Lamanites in the wilderness; yea, I say unto you, they were in captivity, and again the Lord did deliver them out of >bondage by the power of his word; and we were brought into this land, and here we began to establish the church of God throughout this land also.
6 And now behold, I say unto you, my brethren, you that belong to this church, have you sufficiently retained in °remembrance the cap- tivity of your fathers? Yea, and have you sufficiently retained_in remembrance his mercy and long- suffering towards them? And more- over, have ye sufficiently retained in remembrance that he has >delivered their souls from hell?
7 Behold, he changed their hearts; yea, he awakened them out of a deep sleep, and they awoke unto God. Behold, they were in the midst of darkness; nevertheless, their souls were illuminated by the light of the everlasting word; yea, they were encircled about by the “bands of death, and the °chains of. hell, and an everlasting destruction did await them.
8 And now I ask of you, my
brethren, were they destroyed? | Behold, I say unto you, Nay, they | were not.
9 And again I ask, were the bands of death broken, and the “chains of hell which encircled them about, were they loosed? I say unto you, | Yea, they were loosed, and their | souls did expand, and they did ’sing redeeming love. And I say unto you that they are saved.
10 And now I ask of you on what | conditions are they “saved? Yea, what grounds had they to hope for salvation? What is the cause of their being loosed from the bands of death, yea, and also the chains of | hell?
11 Behold, I can tell you—did not | my father Alma believe in the | words which were delivered by the *mouth of Abinadi? And was he not a holy prophet? Did he not speak the words of God, and my father Alma believe them?
12 And according to his faith there was a mighty “change wrought in his heart. Behold I say unto you that this is all true.
13 And behold, he “preached the word unto your fathers, and a mighty change was also wrought in their hearts, and they humbled themselves and put their °trust in the true and ‘living God. And behold, they were faithful until the 4end; therefore they were saved.
14 And now behold, I ask of you, my brethren of the church, have ye “spiritually been °born of God? Have ye received his image in your countenances? Have ye experienced this mighty ‘change in your hearts? 15 Do ye exercise faith in the

27 Have ye walked, keeping your- selves “blameless before God? Could ye say, if ye were called to die at this time, within yourselves, that ye have been sufficiently ’humble? That your garments have been ‘cleansed and made white through the blood of Christ, who will come to “¢redeem his people from their sins?
28 Behold, are ye stripped of “pride? I say unto you, if ye are not ye are not prepared to meet God. Behold ye must prepare quickly; for the kingdom of heaven is soon at hand, and such an one hath not eternal life.
29 Behold, I say, is there one among you who is not stripped of “envy? I say unto you that such an one is not prepared; and I would that he should prepare quickly, for the hour is close at hand, and he knoweth not when the time shall come; for such an one is not found guiltless.
30 And again I say unto you, is there one among you that doth make a “mock of his brother, or that heapeth upon him persecutions?
31 Wo unto such an one, for he is not prepared, and the “time is at hand that he must repent or he can- not be saved!
32 Yea, even wo unto all ye “workers of iniquity ; repent, repent, for the Lord God hath spoken it!
33 Behold, he sendeth an invita- tion unto “all men, for the °arms of mercy are extended towards them,
220
and he saith: Repent, and I will receive you.
34 Yea, he saith: "Come unto me and ye shall partake of the fruit of the tree of life; yea, ye shall eat and drink of the ‘bread and the waters of life “freely;
35 Yea, come unto me and bring forth works of righteousness, and ye shall not be hewn down and cast into the fire—
36 For behold, the time is at hand that whosoever “bringeth forth not good fruit, or whosoever doeth not the works of righteousness, the same have cause to wail and mourn.
37 O ye workers of iniquity; ye that are “puffed up in the vain things of the world, ye that have professed to have known the ways of righteousness nevertheless have gone Yastray, as ‘sheep having no 4shepherd, notwithstanding a shep- herd hath ‘called after you and is still calling after you, but ye will not ‘hearken unto his voice!

57 And now I say unto you, all you that are desirous to follow the voice of the “good shepherd, come ye out from the wicked, and be ye ’separate, and-touch not their un- clean things; and behold, their names shall be “blotted out, that the names of the wicked shall not be numbered among the names of the righteous, that the word of God may be fulfilled, which saith: The names of the wicked shall not be mingled with the names of my people;
58 For the names of the righteous shall be written in the “book of life, and unto them will I grant an inheritance at my right hand. And now, my brethren, what have ye to say against this? I say unto you, if ye speak against it, it matters not, for the word of God must be ful- filled.
59 For what shepherd is there among you having many sheep doth not watch over them, that the wolves enter not and devour his flock? And behold, if a wolf enter his “flock doth he not drive him out? Yea, and at the last, if he can, he will destroy him.

CHAPTER6
The Church in Zarahemla is cleansed and set in order—Alma goes to Gideon to preach.
AND now it came to pass that after Alma had made an end of speaking unto the people of the church, which was established in the city of Zarahemla, he “ordained priests and “elders, by laying on his ‘hands according to the order of God, to preside and ¢watch over the church.
2 And it came to pass that who- soever did not belong to the church who “repented of their sins were baptized unto repentance, and were received into the church.
3 And it also came to pass that whosoever did belong to the church that did not “repent of their wicked- ness and humble themselves before God—I mean those who were lifted up in the ’pride of their hearts— the same were rejected, and their names were “blotted out, that their names were not numbered among those of the righteous.

4 And thus they began to establish the order of the church in the “city of Zarahemla.
5 Now I would that ye should understand that the word of God was liberal unto all, that none were deprived of the privilege of assem- bling themselves together to hear the word of God.
6 Nevertheless the children of God were commanded that they should gather themselves together oft, and join in *fasting and mighty prayer in behalf of the welfare of the souls of those who knew not God.
7 And now it came to pass that when Alma had made these regula- tions he departed from them, yea, from the church which was in the city of Zarahemla, and went over upon the east of the “river Sidon, into the valley of Gideon, there having been a city built, which was called the city of Gideon, which was in the valley that was called Gideon, being called after the man who was ‘slain by the hand of Nehor with the sword.
8 And Alma went and began to declare the word of God unto the church which was established in the valley of Gideon, according to the revelation of the truth of the word which had been spoken by his fathers, and according to the spirit of prophecy which was in him, according to the “testimony of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who should come to redeem his people from their sins, and the holy order by which he was called. And thus it is written. Amen.

CHAPTER7
Christ shall be born of Mary—He shall loose the bands of death and bear the sins of his people—Those who repent, are baptized, and keep the commandments shall have eternal life—Filthiness cannot inherit the kingdom of God—Humility, faith, hope, and charity are required.
BEHOLD my beloved brethren, seeing that I have been permitted to come unto you, therefore I attempt to address you in my language; yea, by my “own mouth, seeing that it is the first time that I have spoken unto you by the words of my mouth, I having been wholly confined to the °judgment-seat, having had much business that I could not come unto you.
2 And even I could not have come now at this time were it not that the judgment-seat hath been “given to another, to reign in my stead; and the Lord in much mercy hath granted that I should comeunto you.
3 And behold, I have come having great hopes and much desire that I should find that ye had humbled yourselves before God, and that ye had continued in the supplicating of his grace, that I should find that ye were blameless before him, that I should find that ye were not in the awful “dilemma that our brethren were in at Zarahemla.
4 But blessed be the name of God, that he hath given me to know, yea, hath given unto me the exceedingly great joy of knowing that they are established again in the way of his righteousness.
5 And I trust, according to the Spirit of God which is in me, that I shall also have joy over you; never- theless I do not desire that my joy over you should come by the cause

of so much afflictions and sorrow which I have had for the brethren | at Zarahemla, for behold, my joy | cometh over them after wading through much affliction and sorrow.
6 But behold, I trust that ye are not ina state of so much unbelief as were your brethren; I trust that ye are not lifted up in the pride of your hearts; yea, I trust that ye have not set your hearts upon riches and the vain things of the world; yea, I trust that you do not worship “idols, but that ye do worship the true and the “living God, and that ye look forward for the remission of your sins, with an everlasting faith, which is to come.
7 For behold, I say unto you there be many things to come; and behold, there is one thing which is of more importance than they all— for behold, the “time is not far distant that the Redeemer liveth and cometh among his people.
8 Behold, I do not say that he will come among us at the “time of his dwelling in his mortal tabernacle; for behold, the Spirit hath not said © unto me that this should bethe case. Now as to this thing I do not know; but this much I do know, that the Lord God hath power to do all things which are according to his word.
9 But behold, the Spirit hath said || this much unto me, saying: Cry © unto this people, saying—‘Repent | ye, and prepare the way of the Lord, and walk in his paths, which are straight; for behold, the king- dom of heaven is at hand, and the Son of God °cometh upon the face of the earth.

11 And he shall go forth, suffering pains and “afflictions and ’tempta- tions of every kind; and this that the word might be fulfilled which saith he will ‘take-upon him the pains and the sicknesses of his people.
12 And he will take upon him ‘death, that he may loose the bands of death which bind his people; and he will take upon him their infirmities, that his bowels may be filled with mercy, accord- ing to the flesh, that he may know according to the flesh how to ‘succor his people according to their infirmities.
13 Now the Spirit *knoweth all things; nevertheless the Son of God suffereth according to the °flesh that he might ‘take upon him the sins of his people, that he might blot out their transgressions accord- ing to the power of his deliverance; and now behold, this is the testi- mony which is in me.
14 Now I say unto you that ye must “repent, and be born again; for the Spirit saith if ye are not born again ye cannot inherit the kingdom of heaven; therefore come and be baptized unto repentance, that ye may be washed from your sins, that ye may have faith on the Lamb of God, who taketh away the sins of the world, who is mighty to save and to cleanse from all. un- righteousness.
15 Yea, I say unto you come and fear not, and lay aside every sin, which easily doth “beset you, which doth bind you down to destruction, yea, come and go forth, and show

17 And now my beloved brethren, do you believe these things? Be- hold, I say unto you, yea, I know
that ye believe them; and the way
that I know that ye believe them is by the manifestation of the Spirit which is in me. And now because your faith is strong concerning that, yea, concerning the things which I have spoken, great is my joy.
18 For as I said unto you from the beginning, that I had much desire that ye were not in the state of “dilemma like your brethren, even so I have found that my desires have been gratified.
19 For I perceive that ye are in the paths of righteousness; I perceive that ye are in the path which leads to the kingdom of God; yea, I perceive that ye are making his “paths straight.
20 I ‘perceive that it has been made known unto you, by the testimony of his word, that he can- not “walk in crooked paths; neither doth he vary from that which he hath said; neither hath he a shadow of turning from the right to the left, or from that which is right to that which is wrong; therefore, his course is one eternal round.

22 And now my beloved brethren, I have said these things unto you that I might awaken you to a sense of your duty to God, that ye may walk blameless before him, that ye may walk after the holy order of God, after which ye have been received.
23 And now I would that ye should be “humble, and be submissive and gentle; easy to be entreated; full of patience and long-suffering; being temperate in all things; being diligent in keeping the command- ments of God at all times; asking for whatsoever things ye stand in need, both spiritual and temporal; always returning thanks unto God for whatsoever things ye do receive.

Alma preaches and baptizes in | Melek—He is rejected in Ammoni- | hah and leaves—An angel commands him to return and cry repentance unto the people—He is received by Amulek, and the two of them preach in Ammonihah.
AND now it came to pass that Alma returned from the “land of Gideon, after having taught the people of Gideon many things which cannot be written, having established the vorder of the church, according as he had before done in the land of Zarahemla, yea, he returned to his own house at Zarahemla to rest himself. from the labors which he had performed.
2 And thus ended the ninth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.
3 And it came to pass in the com- mencement of the *tenth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi, that Alma departed from thence and took his journey over into the land of “Melek, on the west of the river Sidon, on the west by the borders of the wilderness.
4 And he began to teach the people in the land of Melek accord- ing to the “holy order of God, by which he had been called; and he began to teach the people through- out all the land of Melek.

the borders of the land which was by the wilderness side. And they were baptized throughout all-the land;
‘6 So that when he had finished his work at Melek he departed thence, and traveled three days’ journey on the north: of the land of Melek; and he came to a city which was called
2Ammonihah.
7 Now it was the custom of the people of Nephi to call their lands, and their cities, and their villages, yea, even all their small villages, after the ?name of him who first possessed them; and thus it was with the land of Ammonihah.
8 And it came to pass that when Alma had come to the city of Am- monihah he began-to preach the word of God unto them.
9 Now Satan had gotten great *hold upon the hearts of the people of the city of Ammonihah; therefore they would not hearken unto the words of Alma.
10 Nevertheless Alma “labored much in the spirit, °wrestling with God in ‘mighty prayer, that he would pour out his Spirit upon the people who were in the city; that he would also grant that he might baptize them unto repentance.
11 Nevertheless, they hardened their hearts, saying unto him: Be- hold, we know that thou art Alma; and we know that thou art high priest over the church which thou hast established in many parts of the land, according to your tradi- tion; and we are not of thy church, and we do not believe in such foolish traditions.
12 And now we know that because we are not of thy church we know that thou hast no power over us; and thou hast delivered up the judgment- seatunto“Nephihah; therefore thou art_not the chief judge over us.

13 Now when the people had said this, and withstood all his words, and “reviled him, and spit upon him, and caused that he should be °cast out of their city, he departed thence and took his journey towards the city which was called Aaron.
14 And it came-to pass that while he was journeying thither, being weighed down with sorrow, wading through much “tribulation and anguish of soul, because of the wickedness of the people who were inthe city of Ammonihah, it came to pass while Alma was thus weighed down with sorrow, behold an ’angel of the Lord appeared unto him, saying:
15 Blessed art thou, Alma; there- fore, lift up thy head and rejoice, for thou hast great cause to rejoice; for thou hast been faithful in keep- ing the commandments of God from the time which thou receivedst thy first message from him. Behold, I am he that delivered it unto you.
16 And behold, I am sent to ?com- mand thee that thou return to the city of Ammonihah, and preach again. unto the people of the city; yea, preach unto them. Yea, say unto them, except they repent: the Lord God will ’destroy them.
17 For behold, they do study at this time that they may destroy the liberty of thy people, (for thus saith the Lord) which is contrary to the *statutes, and judgments, and com- mandments which he has given unto his people.
18 Now it came to pass that after Alma had received his message from the angel of the Lord he returned speedily to the land of Ammonihah. And he-entered the city by another way, yea, by the way which is on the south of the city of Ammonihah.
19 And as “he entered the city he

saying: Go; and also say unto my | servant *Amulek, go forth and | prophesy unto this people, saying— | Repent ye, for thus saith the Lord, | except ye repent I will visit this | people in mine anger; yea, and I | will not turn my °fierce anger | away.
30 And Alma went forth, and also | Amulek, among the people, to | declare the words of God unto them; and they were filled with the Holy | Ghost.
31 And they had “power given unto | them, insomuch that they could not | be confined in dungeons; neither | was it possible that any man could | slay them; nevertheless they did not | exercise their (power until they were || bound in bands and cast into prison. | Now, this was done that the Lord | might show forth his power in them. ||

20 And the man said unto him: I.am a Nephite, and I know that thou art a holy prophet of God, for thou art the man whom an angel said in a vision: Thou shalt receive. Therefore, go with me into my house and I will impart unto thee of my ‘food; and I know that thou wilt be a blessing unto me and my house.
21 And it came to pass that the man received him into his house; and the man was called Amulek; and he brought forth bread and meat and set before Alma.
22 And it came to pass that Alma ate bread and was filled; and he “blessed Amulek and his house, and he gave thanks unto God.
23 And after he had eaten and was filled he said unto-Amulek: I am Alma, and.am the “high priest over the church of God throughout the land.
24 And behold, I have been called to preach the word of God among all this people, according to the spirit of revelation and prophecy; and I was in this land and they would not receive me, but they “cast me out and I was about to set my back towards this land forever.
25 But behold, I have been com- manded that I should turn again and prophesy unto this people, yea, and to testify against them con- cerning their iniquities.
26 And now, Amulek, because thou hast fed me and taken me in, thou art blessed; for I was an hungered, for I had fasted many days.
27 And Alma “tarried many days with Amulek before he began to preach unto the people.
28 And it came to pass that the people did wax more gross in their iniquities.
29 And the word came to Alma,
The words of Alma, and also the words of Amulek, which were declared || unto the people who were in the land of

AND again, I, Alma, having been commanded of God that 1 should take Amulek and. go--forth and preach again unto this people, or the people who were in the city of *Ammonihah, it came to pass as I began to preach unto them, they began to contend with me, saying:
2 Who art thou? Suppose ye that we shall believe the testimony of “one man, although he should preach unto us that the earth should pass away?
3 Now they understood not the words which they spake; for they knew not that the earth should pass away.
4 And they said also: We will not believe thy words if thou shouldst prophesy that this great city should be destroyed in “one day:
5 Now they knew not that God could do such marvelous “works, for they were a hard-hearted and a stiffnecked people.
6 And they said: “Who is God, that sendeth °no more authority than one man. among this people, to declare unto them the truth of such great and marvelous things?
7 And they stood forth to lay their hands on me; but behold, they did not. And I stood with boldness to declare unto them, yea, I did boldly testify unto them, saying:

how many times he “delivered our fathers out of the hands of their enemies, and preserved them from being destroyed, even by the hands of their own brethren?
11 Yea, and if it had not been for his matchless power, and his mercy, and his “long-suffering towards us, we should unavoidably have been cut off from the face of the earth long before this period of time, and perhaps been consigned to a state of °endless misery and woe.
12 Behold, now I say unto you that he commandeth you to repent; and except ye repent, ye can in nowise inherit the kingdom of God. But behold, this is not all—he has com- manded you to repent, or he will utterly “destroy you from off the face of the earth; yea, he will visit you in his "anger, and in his ‘fierce anger he will not turn away.

14 Now I would that ye should remember, that inasmuch as- the Lamanites have not kept the com- mandments of God, they have been “cut off from the presence of the Lord. Now we see that the word of the Lord has been verified in this thing, and the Lamanites have been cut off from his presence, from the beginning of their transgressions in the land.

yea, and even more tolerable for them in this life than for you, except ye repent. :

17 And at some period of time they will be “brought to believe in his word, and to know of the incorrect- ness of the traditions of their fathers; and many of them will be saved, for the Lord will be merciful unto all who ’call on his name.
18 But behold, I say unto you that if ye persist in your wickedness that your days shall not be “prolonged in the land, for the °Lamanites shall be sent upon you; and if ye repent not they shall come in a time when you know not, and ye shall be visited with ‘utter destruction; and it shall be according to the fierce “anger of the Lord.
19 For he will not suffer you that ye shall live in your iniquities, to *¢destroy his people. I say unto you, Nay;he would rather suffer that the Lamanites might destroy all his people who are called the people of Nephi, if it were possible that they could fall into sins and trans- gressions, after having had so much light and so much knowledge given unto them of the Lord their God;

25 And now for this cause, that ye may not be destroyed, the Lord has sent his angel to visit many of his people, declaring unto them that they must go forth and cry mightily unto this people, saying: ?Repent ye, for the kingdom of heaven is nigh at hand;
26 And “not many days hence the Son of God shall come in his glory; and his glory shall be the glory of the Only Begotten of the Father, full of ‘grace, equity, and truth, full of. patience, ¢mercy, and long- suffering, quick to *hear the cries of his people and. to answer -their prayers.

29 Now behold, this is the voice of the angel, crying unto the people.

ing that ye are’a “lost and a fallen people.
31 Now it came to pass that when I, Alma, had spoken these words, behold, the people were wroth with me because I said unto them that they were a hard-hearted and a *stiffnecked people.
32 And also because I said unto them that: they were a lost and a fallen people they were angry with me, and sought to lay their hands upon me, that they might cast me into prison.
33 But it came to pass that the Lord did not suffer them that they should take me “at that time and cast me into prison.
34 Andit came to pass that Amulek went and stood forth, and began to preach unto them also. And now the *wordsiof Amulek are not all written, nevertheless a part of his words are written in this book.
CHAPTER 10
Lehi descended from. Manasseh— Amulek recounts the angelic command that he care for Alma—The prayers of the righteous cause the people to be spared—Unrighteous lawyers and Judges lay the foundation. of. the destruction of the people.
Now these: are the “words which >’Amulek preached unto the people who were in the land of Ammonihah, saying:
2 1 am Amulek; Iam the son of Giddonah, who was the son of Ishmael, who was a descendant of Aminadi; and it’ was ‘that same Aminadi who interpreted the ¢writ- ing which was upon the wall of the temple, which was written by the finger of God.

3 And Aminadi was a descendant of Nephi, who was the son of Lehi, who came out of the land of Jerusalem, who was a descendant of “Manasseh, who was the son of »’Joseph who was ‘sold into Egypt by the hands of his brethren.
4 And behold, I am also a man of no small “reputation among all those who know me; yea, and behold, 1 have many kindreds and friends, and I have also acquired much riches by the hand of my ‘industry.
5 Nevertheless, after all this, I never have known much of the ways of the Lord, and his “mysteries and marvelous power. I said I never had known much of these things; but behold, I mistake, for-l have seen much. of his mysteries and his marvelous power; yea, even in the preservation of the lives: of this
people.
6 Nevertheless, I did harden my heart, for I was “called many times and I would not "hear; therefore I knew concerning these things, yet I would not know; therefore I went on rebelling ‘against God, in the wickedness of my heart, even until the fourth day of this seventh month, which is in the tenth year of
the reign of the judges.
7 As I was journeying to see a very near kindred, behold an “angel of the. Lord appeared unto me and said: Amulek, return to thine own house, for thou shalt feed a prophet of the Lord; yea, a holy man, who is a chosen man of God; *fasted many days because of the sins of this people, and he is an hungered, and thou shalt ‘receive him ‘into thy house and feed him, and he shall bless thee and thy

behold it was this same man who has been speaking unto you concern- ing the things of God.
9 And the angel said unto me heisa “holy man; wherefore I know he is a holy man because it was said by an angel of God.
10 And again, I know that the things whereof he hath testified are true; for behold I say unto you, that-as the Lord liveth, even so has he sent his “angel to make these things manifest unto me; and this he has done while this Alma hath °dwelt at my house.
11 For behold, he hath “blessed mine house, he hath blessed me, and
‘my women, and my children, and my father and my kinsfolk; yea, even all my kindred hath he blessed, and the blessing of the Lord hath rested upon us according to the words which he spake.
12 And now, when Amulek had spoken these words the people began to be astonished, seeing there was “more than one witness who testified of the things whereof they were accused, and also of the things which were to come, according to the spirit of prophecy which was in

14. Now it was those men who sought to destroy them, who were “lawyers, who were hired or ap- pointed by the people to administer the law at their times of trials, or at the trials of the crimes of the people before the judges.
15 Now these lawyers were learned in all the arts and “cunning of the people; and this was to enable them that they might be skilful.in their profession.
16 And it came to pass that they began to question Amulek,. that thereby they might make. him “cross his words, or contradict the words which he should speak.
17 Now they knew not. that Amulek could *know of their de- signs. But it came-to pass as they began to question him, he perceived their thoughts, and he said unto them: O ye wicked and perverse ‘generation, ye lawyers and hypo- crites, for ye are laying the founda- tions of the devil; for ye are laying 4traps and snares to catch the holy ones of God.
18 Ye are laying plans-to “pervert the ways. of the rightecus, and to bring down the wrath of God upon your heads, even to the utter destruction of this people.

20 And now [say unto you that well doth the Lord “judge of your iniquities; well doth he cry unto this people, by the voice of his *angels: Repent ye, repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.
21 Yea, well doth he cry, by the voice of his angels that: 71 will come downamong my people, with equity and justice in my hands.
22 Yea, and I say unto you that if it were not for the “prayers of the righteous, who are now in the land, that ye would even now be visited with utter destruction; yet it would not be by flood, as were the people in the days of ‘Noah, but it would be by famine, and by pestilence, and the “sword.
23 But it is by the “prayers of the righteous that ye are spared; now therefore, if ye will °cast out the righteous from among you then will not the Lord stay his hand; but in his fierce anger he will come out against you; then ye shall be smitten by famine, and by pestilence, and by the sword; and the ‘time is soon at hand except ye repent.
24 And now it came to pass that the people were more angry with Amulek, and they cried out, saying: This man doth revile against our laws which are just, and our wise “4awyers whom we have selected.

perverse generation, why hath Satan got such great hold upon your hearts? Why will ye yield yourselves unto him that he may have power over you, to “blind your eyes, that ye will not understand the words which are spoken, ac- cording to their truth?
26 For behold, have I testified against your law? Ye do not under- stand; ye say that I have spoken against your law; but I have not, but I have spoken in favor of your law, to your condemnation.
27 And now behold, I say unto you, that the foundation of the “destruc- tion of this people is beginning to be laid by the unrighteousness of your ‘lawyers and your judges.
28 And now it came to pass that when Amulek had spoken these words the people cried out against him, saying: Now we know that this man is a “child of the devil, for he hath Ylied unto us; for he hath spoken against our law. And now he says that he has not spoken against it.
29 And again, hehas reviled against our lawyers, and our judges.
30 And it came to pass that the lawyers put it into their hearts that they should remember these things against him.
31 And there was one among them whose name was Zeezrom. Now he was the foremost to “7accuse Amulek and Alma, he being one of the most expert among them, having much business to do among the people.
32 Now the object of these lawyers was to get gain; and they got gain according to their employ.

those who inherit the kingdom of heaven are saved—aAll men shall rise | in immortality—There is no death | after the resurrection. |
Now it was in the law of Mosiah | that every man who was a judge of the law, or those who were ap- | pointed to be judges, should receive | wages "according to the time which | they labored to judge those who were brought before them to be judged.
2 Now if a man owed another, and he would not “pay that which he did owe, he was complained of to the judge; and the judge executed authority, and sent forth officers that the man should be brought before him; and he judged the man according to the law and the evidences which were brought against him, and thus the man was compelled to pay that which he owed, or be stripped, or be cast out from among the people as a thief and a robber.
3 And the judge received for his wages “according to his time—a *senine of gold for a day, or a senum of silver, which is equal to a senine of gold; and this is according to the law which was given.
4 Now these are the names of the | different pieces of their gold, and of || their silver, according to their value. And the names are given by the Nephites, for they did not reckon || after the “manner of the Jews who |) were at Jerusalem; neither did they measure after the manner of the Jews; but they altered their reckon- ing and their measure, according to the minds and the circumstances of thepeople, in every generation, until

5. Now the reckoning is thus—a senine of gold, a seon of gold, a shum of gold, and a limnah of gold.
6 A senum of silver, an amnor of Silver, an ezrom of silver, and an onti of silver.
7 A senum of silver was equal to a senine of gold, and: either for a measure of barley, and also for a measure of every kind of grain.
8 Now the amount of a seon of gold was twice the value of a senine.
9 Anda shum of gold was twice the value of a seon.
10 And a limnah of gold was the value of them all.
11 And an amnor of silver was as great as two senums.
12 And an ezrom of silver was as great as four senums.
‘3 And an onti was as great as them all.
14 Now this is the value of the lesser numbers of their reckoning—
15 A shiblon is half of a senum; therefore, a  shiblon- for half a measure of barley.
16 And a shiblum is a half of a shiblon.
17 And a leah is the half of a shiblum.
18 Now this is their number, according to their reckoning.
19 Now an antion of gold is equal to three shiblons.
20 Now, it was for the sole purpose to get °gain, because they received their wages according to _ their employ, therefore, they did ‘stir up the people to “riotings, and all manner of disturbances and wicked- ness, that they might have more employ, that they might ‘get fmoney according to the suits which were brought before them; there- fore they did stir up the people against Alma and Amulek.

21 And this Zeezrom began to question Amulek, saying: Will ye answer me a few questions which I shall ask you? Now Zeezrom was a man who was “expert in the °devices of the devil, that he might destroy that which was good; therefore, he said unto Amulek: Will ye answer the questions which I shall put unto you?
22 And Amulek said unto him: Yea, if it be according to the °Spirit of the Lord, which is in me; for I shall say nothing which is contrary to the Spirit of the Lord. And Zeezrom said unto him: Behold, here are six onties of silver, and all these will I ’give thee if thou wilt deny the existence of a Supreme Being.
23 Now Amulek said: O thou ¢child of hell, why ’tempt ye me? Knowest thou that the righteous yieldeth to no such temptations?
24 Believest thou that there is no God? I say unto you, Nay, thou knowest that there is a God, but thou lovest that “lucre more than him.
25 And now thou hast lied before God unto me. Thou saidst unto me— Behold these six onties, which are of great worth, I will give unto thee— when thou hadst it in thy heart to retain them from me; and it was only thy desire that I should deny the true and living God, that thou mightest have cause to destroy me. And now behold, for this great evil thou shalt have thy reward.
26 And Zeezrom said unto him: Thou sayest there is a true and living God?
27 And Amulek said: Yea, there is a true and living God.

things?

32 And Zeezrom said again: Who is he that shall come? Is it the Son
of God?
33 And he said unto him, Yea.
34 And Zeezrom said again: Shall he save his people “in their sins? And Amulek answered and said unto him: I say unto you he shall not, for it is impossible for him to deny
his word.
35 Now Zeezrom said unto the people: See that ye remember these things; for he said there is but one God; yet he saith that the Son of God shall come, but he shall “not save his people—as though he had authority to command God.
36 Now Amulek saith again unto him: Behold thou hast “lied, for thou sayest that I spake as though I had authority to command God because I said he shall not save his
people in their sins.
37 And I say unto you again that he cannot save them in their “sins; for I cannot deny his word, and he hath said that °no unclean thing can inherit the ‘kingdom of heaven; therefore, how can ye be saved, except ye inherit the kingdom of heaven? Therefore, ye cannot be
saved in your sins.

46 Now, when Amulek had finished these words the people began again to be astonished, and also Zeezrom began to tremble. And thus ended the words of Amulek, or this is all that I have written.
CHAPTER 12
Alma contends with Zeezrom—The mysteries of God can be given only to the faithful—Men are judged by their thoughts, beliefs, words, and works— The wicked shall suffer a spiritual death—This mortal life is a_pro- bationary state—The plan of redemp- tionbringsto pass the resurrection and, through faith, a remission of sins— The repentant have a claim on mercy through the Only Begotten Son.
Now Alma, seeing that the words of Amulek had _ silenced Zeezrom, for he beheld that Amulek had caught him in his “lying and de- ceiving to destroy him, and seeing that he began to tremble under a

’consciousness of his guilt, he opened his mouth and began to speak unto him, and to establish the words of Amulek, and to explain things beyond, or to unfold the scriptures beyond that which Amulek had done.
2 Now the words that Alma spake unto Zeezrom were heard by the people round about; for the multi- tude was great, and he spake on this wise:
3 Now Zeezrom, seeing that thou hast been taken in thy lying and craftiness, for thou hast not lied unto men only but thou hast lied unto. God; for behold, he knows all thy “thoughts, and thou seest that thy °thoughts are made known unto us by his Spirit;
4 And thou seest that we know that thy plan was a very “subtle plan, as to the subtlety of the devil, for to lie and to deceive this people that thou mightest set them against us, to ’revile us and to cast us out—
5 Now this was a plan of. thine ®adversary, and he hath exercised his power in thee. Now I would that ye should remember that what I say unto thee I say unto all.
6 And behold I say unto you all that this was a “snare of the ad- versary, which he has laid to catch this people, that he might bring you into subjection unto him, that he might encircle you about with his *chains, that he might chain you down to everlasting destruction, according to the power of his captivity.
7 Now when. Alma had spoken these words, Zeezrom began to tremble more exceedingly, for he was convinced more and more of the power of God; and he was also

ALMA 12:8-16
convinced that Alma and Amulek had a knowledge of him, for he was convinced that they “knew the thoughts and intents of his heart; for power was given unto them that they might know of these things according to the spirit of prophecy.
8 And Zeezrom began to inquire of them diligently, that he might know more concerning the kingdom of God. And he said unto Alma: What does this mean which Amulek hath spoken concerning the resurrection of the dead, that all shall rise from the dead, both the “just and the unjust, and are brought to stand before God to be °judged according to their works?
9 And now Alma began to expound these things unto him, saying: It is given unto many to “Know the b’mysteries of God; nevertheless they are laid under a strict:command that they shall not impart ‘only accord- ing to the portion of his word which he doth grant unto the children of men, according to the heed and dili- gence which they give unto him.
10 And therefore, he that will *harden his heart, the same receiv- eth the "lesser portion of the word; and he that will ‘not harden his heart, to him is “given the greater portion of the word, until it is given unto him to know the mysteries of God until he know them in full.
11 And they that will harden their hearts, to them is given the lesser “portion of the word until they ’know nothing concerning his mys- teries; and then they are taken
238
captive by the devil, and led by his will down to destruction. Now this is what is meant by the ‘chains of ‘hell.
12 And Amulek hath spoken plainly concerning “death, and being raised from this mortality to a state of immortality, and being brought before the bar of God, to be "judged according to our works.
13 Then if our hearts have been hardened, yea, if we have hardened our hearts against the word, inso- much that it has not been found in us, then will our state be awful, for then we shall be condemned.
14 For our 2words will condemn us, yea, all our works will condemn us; we shall not be found spotless; and our thoughts will also condemn us; and in this awful state we shall not dare to look up to our God; and we would fain be glad if we could com- mand the rocks and the ’mountains to fall upon us to ‘hide us from his presence.
15 But this cannot be; we must come forth and stand before him in his glory, and in his power, and in his might, majesty, and dominion, and acknowledge to our everlasting 4shame that all his "judgments are just; that he is just in all his works, and that he is merciful unto the children of men, and that he has all power to save every man_ that believeth on his name and bringeth forth fruit meet for repentance.
16 And now behold, I say unto you then cometh a death, even a second *death, which is a spiritual death;

then is a time that whosoever dieth in his sins, as to.a temporal °death, Shall also ‘die a spiritual death; yea, he shall die as to things pertaining unto righteousness.
17 Then is the time when ‘their torments shall be as a “lake of fire and brimstone, whose flame ascend- eth up forever and ever; and then is the time that they shall be chained down to an everlasting destruction, according to the power and captivity of Satan, he having subjected them according to his will.
18 Then, [say unto you, they shall be as though there had been ?no redemption made; for they cannot be redeemed according to God’s justice; and they cannot ’die, seeing there is no more corruption.
19 Now it came to pass that when Alma had made an end of speaking these words, the people began to be more astonished ;
20 But there was one Antionah, who was a chief ruler among them, came forth and said unto him: What is this that thou hast said, that man should rise from the dead and be changed from this mortal to an *%immortal state, that the soul can never die?
21 What does the scripture mean, which saith that God placed *cheru- bim and a flaming sword on the east of the garden of ’Eden, lest our first parents should enter and partake of the fruit of the tree of life, and live forever? And thus we see that there was no possible chance that they should live forever.
22 Now Alma said unto him: This
ALMA 12:17-26
is the thing which I was about to explain. Now we see that Adam did “fall by the partaking of the for- bidden °fruit, according to the word of God; and thus we see, that by his fall, all mankind became a“lost and fallen people.
23 And now behold, I say unto you that if it had been possible for Adam to have “partaken of the fruit of the tree of life at that time, there would have been no death, and the word would have been void, making God a liar, for he said: "If thou eat thou shalt surely die.
24 And we see that “death comes upon mankind, yea, the death which has been spoken of by Amulek, which is the temporal death; nevertheless there was a space granted unto ’man in which he might repent; therefore this life became a ‘probationary state; a time to ¢prepare to meet God; a time to prepare for that endless state which has been spoken of by us, which is after the resurrection of the dead.
25 Now, if it had not been for the plan of redemption, which was laid from the foundation of the world, there could have been no “resurrec- tion of the dead; but there was a plan of ’redemption laid, which shall bring to pass the resurrection of the dead, of which has been spoken.
26 And now behold, if it were possible that our first parents could have gone forth and partaken of the “tree of life they would have been forever miserable, having no pre- paratory state; and thus the ’plan

of redemption would have been frustrated, and the word of God would have been void, taking none effect.
27 But behold, it was not so; but it was “appointed unto men that they must die; and after death, they must come to °judgment, even that same judgment of which we have spoken, which is the end.
28 And after God had appointed that these things should come unto man, behold, then he saw that it was expedient that man _ should know concerning the things whereof he had appointed unto them;
29 Therefore he sent “angels to converse with them, who caused men to behold of his glory.
30 And they began from that time forth to call on his name; therefore God “conversed: with men, and made known unto them the "plan of redemption, which had been pre- pared from the ‘foundation of the world; and this he made known unto them according to their faith and repentance and their “holy works.
31 Wherefore, he gave *command- ments unto men, they having first transgressed the °first command- ments as to things which were temporal, and becoming as Gods, ‘knowing good from evil, placing themselves in a state to “act, or being placed in a state to act according to their wills and pleasures, whether to do evil or to do good—
32 Therefore God gave unto them commandments, after having made "known unto them the plan of
240
redemption, that they should not do evil, the penalty thereof being a second ’death, which was an ever- lasting ‘death as to things pertain- ing unto righteousness; for on such the plan of redemption could have no power, for the works of “justice could not be destroyed, according to the supreme “goodness of God.
33 But God did call on men, in the name of his Son, (this being the “plan of redemption which was laid) say- ing: If ye will "repent, and harden not your hearts, then will I have mercy upon you, through mine Only Begotten Son;
34 Therefore, whosoever repenteth, and hardeneth not his heart, he shall have claim on “mercy through mine Only Begotten Son, unto a ’remission of his sins; and these shall enter into my ‘rest.
35 And whosoever will harden his heart and will do “iniquity, behold, I swear in my wrath that he shall not enter into my rest.
36 And now, my brethren, behold I say unto you, that if ye will harden your hearts ye shall not enter into the rest of the Lord; therefore your iniquity “‘provoketh him that he sendeth down his "wrath upon you as in the ‘first provocation, yea, according to his word in the last provocation as well as the first, | to the everlasting “destruction of | your souls; therefore, according to his word, unto the last death, as well as the first.
37 And now, my brethren, seeing we know these things, and they are true, let us repent, and harden not

CHAPTER 13
Men are called as high priests because of their exceeding faith and good works —They are to teach the command- ments—Through righteousness they are sanctified and enter into the rest of the Lord—Melchizedek was one of these—Angels are declaring glad tidings throughout the land—They will reveal the actual coming of Christ.
AND again, my brethren, I would cite your minds forward to the time when the Lord God gave these com- mandments unto his children; and I would that ye should remember that the Lord God “ordained priests, after his holy order, which-was after the order of his Son, to teach these things unto the people.
2 And those priests were ordained after the “order of his Son, in a ’manner that thereby the people might know in what manner to look forward to his Son for redemption.
3 And this is the manner after which. they were ordained—being called and prepared from the ‘foundation ofthe world according to the “foreknowledge of God, on account of their-exceeding faith and good works; in the first place being left to “choose good or evil; there- fore they having chosen good, and

exercising exceedingly great ‘faith, are %called with a holy calling, yea, with that holy calling which was prepared with, and according to, a preparatory redemption for such.
4 And thus they have been “called to this holy calling on account of their faith, while others would reject the Spirit of God on account of the hardness of their hearts and °blind- ness of their minds, while, if it had not been for this they might have had as. great ‘privilege as their brethren.
5.Or in fine, in the first place they were on the “same standing with their brethren; thus this holy calling being prepared from the foundation of the world for such as would not harden. their hearts, being in and through the atonement of the Only Begotten Son, who was prepared—
6 And thus being called by this holy calling, and ordained unto the high priesthood of the holy order of God, to teach his commandments unto. the children of men, that they also might enter into his *rest—
7 This high priesthood being after the order of his Son, which order was from the foundation of the world; or in other words, being *without beginning of days or end of years, being prepared from beternity to all eternity, according to his ‘foreknowledge of all things—
8 Now they were “ordained after this manner—being called with a holy calling, and ordained with a holy ordinance, and taking upon them the high priesthood of the holy order, which calling, and ordinance,

and high priesthood, is without beginning or end—
9 Thus they become “high priests forever, after the order of the Son, the Only Begotten of the Father, who is without beginning of days or end of years, who is full of "grace, equity, and truth. And thus it is. Amen.
10 Now; ‘as I said concerning the holy order, or this “high priesthood, there were many who were ordained and became high priests of God; and it was on account of their exceeding faith and ‘repentance, and their righteousness before God, they choosing to repent and work righteousness rather than to perish;
11 Therefore they were called after this holy order, and were “sanctified, and their garments were washed white through the blood of the Lamb.
12 Nowthey, after being “sanctified by the “Holy Ghost, having their garments made white, being ‘pure and spotless before God, could not look upon ‘sin save it were with “abhorrence; and there were many, exceedingly great many, who were made pure and entered into the rest of the Lord their God.
13 And now, my brethren, I would that ye should humble yourselves before God, and bring forth “fruit meet for repentance, that ye may also enter into that rest.
14 Yea, humble yourselves even as the people in the days of “Melchize- dek, who was also a high priest after this same order which I have spoken,

who also took upon him the high priesthood forever.
15 Andit was thissame Melchizedek to whom Abraham paid“tithes ; yea, even our father Abraham paid tithes of one-tenth part of all he possessed.
16 Now these “ordinances were given after this "manner, that there- by the people might look forward on the Son of God, it being a ‘typeof | his order, or it being his order, and | this that they might look forward to him for a remission of their sins, that they might enter into the rest of the Lord.
17 Now this Melchizedek was a king over the land of Salem; and his people had waxed strong in iniquity and abomination; yea, they had all gone astray; they were full of all manner of wickedness ;
18 But Melchizedek having exer- cised mighty faith, and received the office of the high priesthood accord- ing to the “holy order of God, did preach repentance unto his people. And behold, they did repent; and Melchizedek did establish peace in the land in his days; therefore he was called the prince of peace, for he was the king of Salem; and he did reign under his father.
19 Now, there were *many before him, and also there were many afterwards, but ’none were greater; therefore, of him they have more particularly made mention.

before you; if ye will “wrest them it shall be to your own destruction.
21 And now it came to pass that when Alma had said these words unto them, he stretched forth his hand unto them and cried with a mighty voice, saying: “Now is the time to repent, for the day of salva- tion draweth nigh;
22 Yea, and the voice of the Lord, by the “mouth of angels, doth declare it unto all nations; yea, doth declare it, that they may have glad tidings of great joy; yea, and he doth sound these glad tidings among all his people, yea, even to them that are scattered abroad upon the face of the earth; wherefore they have come unto us.
23 And they are made known unto us in “plain terms, that we may understand, that we cannot. err; and this because of our: being >wanderers in a strange land; there- fore, we are thus highly favored, for we have these glad tidings declared unto us in all parts of our vineyard.
24 For behold, “angels are declaring it unto many at this time in our land; and this is for the purpose of preparing the hearts of the children of men to receive his word at the time of his coming in his glory.
25 And now we only wait to hear the joyful news declared unto us by the mouth of angels, of his coming; for the time cometh, we “know not how soon. Would to God that it might. be in my day; but let it be sooner or later, in it I will rejoice.
26 And it shall be made known unto “just and holy men, by the mouth of angels, at the time of his coming,
ALMA 13:21-31
that the words of our fathers may be fulfilled, according to that which they have spoken concerning him, which was according to the spirit of prophecy which was in them.
27 And now, my brethren, I “wish from the inmost part of my heart, yea, with great “anxiety even unto pain, that ye would hearken unto my words, and cast off your sins, and not ‘procrastinate the day of your repentance;
28 But that ye would humble yourselves before the Lord, and call on his holy name, and owatch and pray continually, that ye may not be °tempted above that which ye can bear, and thus be ‘led by the Holy Spirit, becoming humble, 4meex, submissive, patient, full of love and all long-suffering ;
29. “Having faith on the. Lord; having a hope that ye shall receive eternal life; having the “love of God always in your hearts, that ye may be lifted up at the last day and enter into his ‘rest.
30 And may the Lord grant unto you repentance, that ye may not bring down his wrath upon you, that ye may not be “bound down by the chains of "hell, that ye may not suffer the second ‘death.
31 And Alma spake many more words unto the people, which are not written in “this book.

2 But the more part of them were desirous that they might destroy Alma and Amulek; for they were angry with Alma, because of the *%plainness of his words unto Zeez- rom; and they also said that Amulek had "lied unto them, and had reviled against their law and also against their lawyers and judges.
3 And they were also angry with Alma and Amulek; and because they had “testified so plainly against their wickedness, they sought to >put them away privily.
4 But it came to pass that they did not; but they took them and bound them with strong cords, and took them before the chief judge of the land.
5 And the people went forth and witnessed against them—testifying that they had reviled against the law, and their lawyers and judges of the land, and also of all the people that were in the land; and also testified that there was but one God, and that he should send his Son among the people, but he should *not save them; and many such things did the people testify against. Alma and Amulek. Now this was done before the chief judge of the land.
6 And it came to pass that Zeezrom was astonished at the words which had been spoken; and he also knew concerning the “blindness of the minds, which he had caused among the people by his "lying

words; and his soul began to be ‘harrowed up under a ¢conscious- ness of his own guilt; yea, he began to be encircled about by the pains of hell.
7 And it came to pass that he began to: cry unto the people, saying: Behold, I am “guilty, and these men are spotless before God. And he began to plead for them from that time forth; but they reviled him, saying: Art thou also possessed with the devil? And they spit upon him, and °cast him out from among them, and also all those who believed in the words which had been spoken by Alma and Amulek; and they cast them out, and sent men to cast stones at them.
8 And they brought their wives and children together, and who- soever believed or had been taught to believe in the word of God they caused that they should be “cast into the fire; and they also brought forth their records which contained the holy scriptures, and cast them into the fire also, that they might be >burned and destroyed by fire.
9 And it came to pass that they took Alma and Amulek, and carried them forth to the place of *martyr- dom, that they might witness the destruction of those who were con- sumed by fire.
10 And when Amulek saw the pains of the women and children who were consuming in the fire, he also was pained; and he said unto Alma: How can we witness this awful scene? Therefore let us stretch forth our hands, and exercise the “power of God which is in us, and save them from the flames.
11 But Alma said unto him: The Spirit constraineth me that I must not stretch forth mine hand; for behold the Lord receiveth them up

unto himself, in ¢glory; and he doth suffer that they may do this thing, or that the people may do this thing unto them, according to the hard- ness of their hearts, that the *judg- ments which he shall exercise upon them in his wrath may be just; and the ‘blood of the ‘innocent shall stand as a witness against them, yea, and cry mightily against them at the last day.
12 Now: Amulek said unto Alma: ag perhaps they will burn us also.
13 And Alma said: Be it according to the will of the Lord. But, behold, our work is not finished; therefore they burn us not.
14 Now it came to pass that when the bodies of those who had been cast into the fire were consumed, and also the records which were cast in with them, the chief judge of the land came and stood before Alma and Amulek, as they were bound; and he smote them with his hand upon their “cheeks, and said unto them: After what ye have seen, will ye preach again unto this people, that they shall be cast into a "lake of fire and brimstone?
15 Behold, ye see that ye had not power to save those who had been cast into the fire; neither has God saved them because they were of thy faith. And the judge smote them. again upon their cheeks, and asked: What say ye for yourselves?
16 Now this judge was after the order and faith of *Nehor, who slew Gideon.
17 And it came to pass that Alma and Amulek answered him “nothing ; and he smote them again, and delivered them to the officers. to be ‘cast into prison.
18 And when they had been cast
ALMA 14:12-23
into prison three days, there came many “lawyers, and judges, and priests, and teachers, who were of the profession of Nehor; and they came in unto the prison to see them, and they questioned them about many words; but they answered them nothing.
19 And it came to pass that the judge stood before them, and said: Why do ye not answer the words of this people? Know ye not that I have “power to deliver you up unto the flames? And he commanded them to speak; but they answered nothing.
20 And it came to pass that they departed and went their ways, but came again on the morrow; and the judge also smote them again on their cheeks. And many came forth also, and smote them, saying: Will ye stand again and judge this people, and condemn our law? If ye have such great power why do ye not *deliver yourselves?
21 And many such things did they say unto them, gnashing their teeth upon them, and spitting upon them, and saying: How shall we look when we are damned?
22 And many such things, yea, all manner of such things did they say unto them; and thus they did ¢mock them for many days. And they did withhold food from them that they might hunger, and water that they might thirst; and they also did take from them their clothes that they were naked; and thus they were *bound with strong cords, and con- fined in ‘prison.
23 And it came to pass after they had thus suffered for many days, (and it: was on the twelfth day, in the tenth month, *in the tenth year of the reign of the judges over the

24 And the chief judge stood before them, and smote them again, and said unto them: If ye have the "power of God deliver yourselves from these bands, and then we will believe that the Lord will de- stroy this people according to your words.
25 And it came to pass that they all went forth and smote them, say- ing the same words, even until the last; and when the last had spoken unto them the “power of God was upon Alma and Amulek, and they rose and stood upon their feet.
26 And Alma cried, saying: How long shall we suffer these great “afflictions, O Lord? O Lord, °give us strength according to our faith which is in Christ, even unto ‘deliverance. And they broke the cords with which they were bound; and when the people saw this, they began to flee, for the fear of destruc- tion had come upon them.
27 And it came to pass that so great was their fear that they fell to the earth, and did not obtain the outer door of the “prison; and the earth shook mightily, and the walls of the prison were rent in twain, so that they fell to the earth; and the chief judge, and the lawyers, and priests, and teachers, who smote upon Alma and Amulek, were slain by the fall thereof.
28 And Alma and Amulek came forth out of the prison, and they were not hurt; for the Lord had granted unto them “power, accord- ing to their faith which was in

CHAPTER 15
Alma and Amulek go to Sidom and establish a church—Alma heals Zeez- rom, who joins the Church— Many are baptized and the Church prospers— Alma and Amulek go to Zarahemla.
AND it came to pass that Alma and Amulek were commanded to depart out of that city; and they departed, and came out even into the land of Sidom; and behold, there they found | all the people who had departed out | of the land of “Ammonihah, who had been ’cast out and stoned, because they believed in the words of Alma. 2 And they related unto them all | that had happened unto their “wives and children, and also concerning | themselves, and of their "power of deliverance. 3 And also Zeezrom lay sick at Sidom, with a burning fever, which was caused by the great tribulations

of hismind onaccount of his*wicked- ness, for he supposed that Alma and Amulek were no more; and he sup- posed that they had been slain because of his iniquity. And this
great sin, and his many other sins,
did harrow up his mind until it did become exceedingly sore, having no deliverance; therefore he began to be scorched with a burning heat.
4 Now, when he heard that Alma and Amulek were in the land of Sidom, his heart began to take courage; and he sent a message immediately unto them, desiring them to come unto him.
5 And it came to pass that they went immediately, obeying the message which he had sent unto them; and they went in unto the house’ unto Zeezrom; and they found him upon his bed, sick, being very low with a burning fever; and his mind also was “exceedingly sore because of his iniquities; and when he saw them he stretched forth his hand, and besought them that they would heal him. :
6 And it came to pass that Alma said unto him, taking him by the hand: *Believest thou in the power of Christ unto salvation?
7 And he answered and said: Yea, I believe all the words that thou hast taught.
8 And Alma said: If thou believest in the redemption of Christ thou canst be “healed.
9 And he said: Yea, according to thy words.
10 And then Alma cried unto the Lord, saying: O Lord our God, have 4mercy on this man, and "heal him according to his faith which is in Christ.
11 And when Alma had said these words, *Zeezrom leaped upon his

feet, and began to walk; and this was done to the great astonishment of all the people; and the knowledge of this went forth throughout all the land of Sidom.
12 And Alma baptized Zeezrom unto the Lord; and he began from that time forth to preach unto the people.
13 And Alma established a church in the land of Sidom, and con- secrated “priests and °teachers in the land, to baptize unto the Lord who- soever were desirous to be baptized.
14 And it came to pass that they were many; for they did flock in from all the region round about Sidom, and were baptized.
15 But as to the people that were in the land of Ammonihah, they yet remained a hard-hearted and a stiffnecked people; and they re- pented not of their sins, “ascribing all the power of Alma and Amulek to the devil; for they were of the profession of "Nehor, and did not be- lieve in the repentance of their sins.
16 And it came to pass that Alma and Amulek, Amulek having °for- saken all his gold, and silver, and his precious things, which were in the land of Ammonihah, for the word of God, he being "rejected by those who were once his friends and also by his father and his kindred;

18 Now as I said, Alma having seen all these things, therefore he took Amulek and came over to the land of Zarahemla, and took him to his 7own house, and did administer unto him in his tribulations, and *strengthened him in the Lord.
19 And thus ended the tenth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.
CHAPTER 16
The Lamanites destroy the people of Ammonihah—Zoram leads the Ne- phites to victory over the Lamanites— Alma and Amulek and many others preach the word—They teach that after his resurrection Christ will appear to the Nephites.
AND it came to pass in the *eleventh year of the reign of the judges. over the people of Nephi, on the fifth day of the second month, there having been much peace in the land of Zarahemla, there having been no wars nor contentions for a certain number of years, even until the fifth day of the second month in the eleventh year, there was a cry of war heard throughout the land.
2 For behold, the armies of the Lamanites had come in upon the wilderness side, into the borders of the land, even into the city of *Ammonihah, and began to slay the people and destroy the city.
3 And now it came to pass, before the Nephites could raise a sufficient army to drive them out of the land, they had “destroyed the people who were in the city of Ammonihah, and also some around the borders of Noah, and taken others captive into the wilderness,
4 Now it came to pass that the Nephites were desirous to obtain those who had been carried away captive into the wilderness.

5 Therefore, he that had been appointed chief captain over the armies of the Nephites, (and his name was Zoram, and he had two sons, Lehi and Aha)—now Zoram and his two sons, knowing that Alma was high priest over the church, and having heard that he had the spirit of prophecy, there- fore they went unto him and desired of him to know whither the Lord would that they should go into the wilderness in search of their breth- ren, who had been taken captive by the Lamanites.
6 And it came to pass that Alma “inquired of the Lord concerning the matter. And Alma returned and said unto them: Behold, the Laman- ites will cross the river Sidon in the south wilderness, away up beyond the borders of the land of °Manti. And behold there shall ye meet them, on the east of the river Sidon, and there the Lord will deliver unto thee thy brethren who have been taken captive by the Lamanites.
7 And it came to pass that Zoram and his sons crossed over the river Sidon, with their armies, and marched away beyond the borders of Manti into the south wilderness, which was on the east side of the river Sidon.
8 And they came upon the armies of the Lamanites, and the Laman- ites were scattered and driven into the wilderness; and they took their brethren who had been taken cap- tive by the Lamanites, and there was not one soul of them had been lost that were taken captive. And they were brought by their brethren to possess their own lands.
9 And thus ended the eleventh year of the judges, the Lamanites having been driven out of the land, and the people of Ammonihah were “destroyed; yea, "every living soul

of the Ammonihahites was ‘de- stroyed, and also their “great city, which they said Ged: ‘could not destroy, because of its greatness.
10 But behold, in “one day it was left desolate; and the carcases were mangled by dogs and wild beasts of the wilderness.
11 Nevertheless, after many days their “dead bodies were heaped up / upon the face of the earth, and they were covered with a shallow cover- ing. And now so great was the scent thereof that the people did not go in to possess the land of Ammonihah for many years. And it was called Desolation of ’Nehors; for they were of the profession of Nehor, who were slain; and their lands remained desolate.
12 And the Lamanites did not come again to war against the Nephites *until the fourteenth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi. And thus for three years did the people of Nephi have continual peace in all the land.
13 And Alma and Amulek went forth preaching repentance to the people in their ¢temples, and in their ’sanctuaries, and also in their “synagogues, which were built after the manner of the Jews.
14 And as many as would hear their words, unto them they did impart the word of God, without any °respect of persons, continually.
15 And thus did Alma and Amulek go forth, and also many more who had been chosen for the work, to preach the word throughout all the land. And the establishment of the church became general throughout
ALMA 16:10-21
the land, in all the region round about, among all the people of the Nephites.
16 And there was “no inequality among them; the Lord did pour out his Spirit on all the face of the land to prepare the minds of the children of men, or to prepare their "hearts to receive the word which should be taught among them at the time of his coming—
17 That they might not behardened against the word, that they might not be unbelieving, and go on to destruction, but that they might receive the word with joy, and asa *branch be grafted into the true vine, that they might enter into the rest of the Lord their God.
18 Now those “priests who did go forth among the people did preach against all "lyings, and ‘deceivings, and 4envyings, and °strifes, and malice, and revilings, and stealing, robbing, plundering, murdering, committing adultery, and all man- ner of lasciviousness, crying that these things ought not so to be—
19 Holding forth things which must shortly come; yea, holding forth the 2coming of the Son of God, his suffer- ings and death, and also the resur- rection of the dead.
20 And many of the people did inquire concerning the place where the Son of God should come; and they were taught that he would *appear unto them ’after his resur- rection; and this the people did hear with great joy and gladness.
21 And now after the church had been established throughout all the land—having got the “victory over

the devil, and the word of God being preached in its purity in all the land, and the Lord pouring out his bless- ings upon the people—thus ended the fourteenth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.
An account of the sons of Mosiah, who rejected their rights to the kingdom for the word of God, and went up to the land of Nephi to preach to the Lamanites; their sufferings and deliverance—according to the record of Alma. Comprising chapters 17 to 26 inclusive.
CHAPTER 17
The sons of Mosiah have the spirit of prophecy and of revelation—They go their several ways to declare the word to the Lamanites— Ammon goes to the land of Ishmael and becomes the servant of King Lamoni—Ammon saves the king’s flocks and slays his enemies at the waters of Sebus.
AND now it came to pass that as Alma was journeying from the land of Gideon southward, away to the land of *’Manti, behold, to- his astonishment, he met with the ‘sons of Mosiah journeying towards the land of Zarahemla.
2 Now these sons of Mosiah were with Alma at the time the angel “first appeared unto him; therefore Alma did rejoice exceedingly to see his brethren; and what added more to his joy, they were still his breth- ren in the Lord; yea, and they had waxed strong in the knowledge of the truth; for they were men of a sound understanding and they had *searched the scriptures diligently, that they might know the word of God.

3 But this is not all; they had given themselves to much prayer, and “fasting; therefore they had the spirit of prophecy, and the spirit of revelation, and when they taught, they taught with power and authority of God.
4 And they had been teaching the word of God *for the space of four- teen. years among the Lamanites, having had much “success in bring- ing many to the "knowledge of the truth; yea, by the power of their words many were brought before the altar of. God, to call on his name and ‘confess their sins before him.
5 Now these are the circumstances which attended them in their journeyings, for they had many afflictions; they did suffer much, both in body and in mind, such as hunger, thirst and fatigue, and also much “labor in the spirit.
6 Now these were their journey- ings: Having ‘taken leave of their father, Mosiah, in the first year of the judges; having ‘refused the kingdom which their father was desirous to confer upon them, and also this was the minds of the people;
7 Nevertheless they departed out of the land of Zarahemla, and took their swords, and their spears, and their bows, and their arrows, and their slings; and this they did that they might “provide food for them- selves while in the wilderness.
8 And thus they departed into the wilderness with their numbers which they had ‘selected, to go up to the land of Nephi, to preach the word of God unto the Lamanites.
9 And it came to pass that they journeyed many days in the wilder- ness, and they fasted much and “prayed much that the Lord would grant unto them a portion of his

Spirit to go with them, and abide with them, that they might be an *instrument in the hafids of God to bring, if it were possible, their brethren, the Lamanites, to the knowledge of the truth, tothe knowledge of the baseness of the ‘traditions of their fathers, which were not correct.
10 And it came to pass that the Lord did “visit them with his °Spirit, and said unto them: Be “comforted. And they were comforted.
11 And the Lord said unto them also: Goforth among the Lamanites, thy brethren, and establish my word; yet ye shall be “patient in long-suffering and afflictions, that ye may show forth good "examples unto them in me, and I will make an instrument of thee in my hands unto the salvation of many souls.
12 And it came to pass that: the hearts of the sons of Mosiah, and also those who were with them, took courage to go forth unto the Lamanites to declare unto them the word of God.
13 And it came to pass when they had arrived in the borders of the land of the Lamanites, that they separated themselves and departed one from another, trusting in the Lord that they should meet again at the close of their "harvest; for they supposed that great was the work which they had undertaken.
14 And assuredly it was great, for they had undertaken to preach the word of God to a ¢wild and a hard- ened and a ferocious people; a people who: delighted in murdering the Nephites, and robbing and plunder- ing them; and their hearts were set upon riches, or upon gold and silver, and precious stones; yet they sought to obtain these things by murdering

and plundering, that they might not labor for them with their own hands.
15 Thus they were a very indolent people, many of whom did worship idols, and the “curse of God had fallen upon them because of the *traditions of their fathers; not- withstanding the promises of the Lord were extended unto them on the conditions of repentance.
16 Therefore, this was the “cause for which the»sons of Mosiah had undertaken the work, that perhaps they might bring them unto repen- tance; that perhaps they might bring them to know of the plan of redemp- tion.
17 Therefore they separated them- selves one from another, and went forth among them, every man alone, according to the word and power of God which was given unto him.
18 Now Ammon being the chief among them, or rather he did administer unto them, and ‘he departed from them, after having "blessed them according to their several stations, having imparted the word of God unto them, or administered unto them before his departure; and thus they took their several journeys throughout the land.
19 And Ammon went to the land of “Ishmael, the land being called after the sons of Ishmael, who also be- came Lamanites.
20 And as Ammon entered the land of Ishmael, the Lamanites took him and “bound him, as was: their custom to bind all the Nephites who fell into their hands, and carry them before the king; and thus it was left to the pleasure of the king to slay them, or to retain them in captivity, or to cast them into prison, or to

cast them out of his land, according to his will and pleasure.
21 And thus Ammon was carried before the king who was over the land of Ishmael; and his name was Lamoni; and he was a descendant of Ishmael.
22 And the king inquired of Am- mon if it were his desire to dwell in the land among the Lamanites, or among his people.
23 And Ammon said unto him: Yea, I desire to ?dwell among this people for a time; yea, and perhaps until the day I die.
24 And it came to pass that king Lamoni was much pleased with Ammon, and caused that his bands should be loosed; and he would that Ammon. should take one of his daughters to wife.
25 But Ammonsaid untohim: Nay, but I will be thy servant. Therefore Ammon became a “servant to king Lamoni. And it came to pass that he was set among other servants to watch the flocks of Lamoni, accord- ing to the custom of the Lamanites.
26 And after he had been in the service of the king three days, as he was with the Lamanitish servants going forth with their flocks to the place of “water, which was called the water of Sebus, and all the Laman- ites drive their flocks hither, that they may have water—
27 Therefore, as Ammon and the servants of the king were driving forth their flocks to this place of water, behold, a certain number of the Lamanites, who had been with their flocks to water, stood and ¢scat- tered the flocks of Ammon and the servants of the king, and they scattered them insomuch that they fled many ways.
28 Now the servants of the king began to murmur, saying: Now the king will slay us, as he has our brethren because their flocks were scattered by the wickedness of these

men. And they began to weep exceedingly, saying: Behold, our flocks are scattered already.
29 Now they wept because of the fear of being slain. Now when Ammon saw this his heart was swollen within him with joy; for, said he, I will show forth my power unto these my fellow-servants, or the power which is in me, in restor- ing these flocks unto the king, that I may win the hearts of these my fellow-servants, that I may lead them to “believe in my words.
30 And now, these were the thoughts of Ammon, when he saw the afflictions of those whom he termed to be his brethren.
31 And it came to pass that he flattered them by his words, saying: My brethren, be of good cheer and let us go in search of the flocks, and we will gather them together and bring them back unto the place of water; and thus we will preserve the flocks unto the king and he will not slay us.
32 And it came to pass that they went in search of the flocks, and they did follow Ammon, and they rushed forth with much swiftness and did head the flocks of the king, and did gather them together again to the place of water.
33 And those men again stood to scatter their flocks; but Ammon said unto his brethren: Encircle the flocks round about that they flee not; and I go and contend with these men who do scatter our flocks.
34 Therefore, they did as Ammon commanded them, and he went forth and stood to contend with those who stood by the waters of Sebus; and they were in number not a few.
35 Therefore they did not fear Ammon, for they supposed that one of their men could slay him according to their pleasure, for they knew not that the Lord had prom- ised Mosiah that he would “deliver

his sons out of their hands; neither did they know anything  concern- ing the Lord; therefére’ they de- lighted in the destruction of their brethren; and for this cause they stood to scatter the flocks of the king. ;
36 But ¢Ammon steod forth and began to cast stones at them with
his sling; yea, with mighty power:
he did sling stones amongst them; and thus he slew a certain number of:them insomuch that they began to be astonished at his power; nevertheless they were angry be- cause of the slain of their brethren, and they were determined that he should fall; therefore, seeing that they ‘could not hit him with their stones, they came forth with clubs to slay him.
37 But behold, every man that lifted his club ‘to smite Ammon, he smote off their arms with his sword; for he did withstand their blows by smiting their arms with the edge of his sword, insomuch that they began to be astonished, and began to flee before him; yea, and they were not few in number; and he caused them to flee by the strength of his arm.
38. Now six of them had fallen by the sling, but he “slew none save it were their leader with his sword; and he smote off as many of their arms as were lifted against him, and they were not a few.
39 And when he had driven them afar off, he returned and they watered their flocks and returned them to the pasture of the king, and then went in unto the king, bearing the arms which had been smitten off by the sword of Ammon, of those who sought to slay him; and they were carried in unto the king for a testimony of the things which they had done.

CHAPTER 18
King Lamoni supposes that Ammon is the Great Spirit— Ammon teaches the king of the creation, of God’s deal- ings with men, and of the redemption that comes through Christ—Lamoni believes and falls to the earth as if dead.
AND it came to pass that king Lamoni caused that his “servants should stand forth and testify to all the things which they had seen con- cerning the matter.
2 And when they had all testified to the things which they had seen, and he had learned of the faithful- ness of Ammon in preserving his flocks, and also of his *"great power in contending against those who sought to slay him, he was aston- ished exceedingly, and said: Surely, this is more than’a man. Behold, is not this the Great Spirit who doth send such great punishments upon this people, because of their murders?
3 And they answered the king, and said: Whether he be the Great Spirit or a man, we know not; but this much we do know, that he 2cannot be slain by the enemies of the king; neither can they °scatter the king’s flocks when he is with us, because of his expertness and ‘great strength; therefore, we know that heis a friend to the king. And now, O king, we do not believe that aman has such great power, for we know he cannot be slain.
4 And now, when the king heard these words, he said unto them: Now I know that it is the Great Spirit; and he has come down at this time to preserve your lives, that I might not “slay you as I did your brethren. Now this is the Great Spirit of whom our fathers» have spoken.
5 Now this was the “tradition of Lamoni, which he had received from

his father, that there was a Great Spirit. Notwithstanding they _be- lieved in a Great Spirit, they sup- posed that ‘whatsoever they did was. right; nevertheless, Lamoni began to fear exceedingly, with fear lest he had done wrong in slaying his servants;
6 For he had slain many. of them because their brethren had scattered their flocks at the place of water; and thus, because they had had their flocks scattered they were slain.
7 Now it was the practice of these Lamanites to stand by the “waters of Sebus to scatter the flocks of the people, that thereby they might drive away many that werescattered unto their own land, it being a practice of plunder among them.
8 And it came to pass that king Lamoni inquired of his servants, saying: Where is this man that has such great power?
9 And they said unto him: Behold, he is feeding thy “horses. Now the king had commanded his servants, previous to the time of the watering of their flocks, that they should prepare his horses and chariots, and conduct him forth to the land of Nephi; for there had been a °great ‘feast appointed at the land of Nephi, by the father of Lamoni, who was king over all the land.
10 Now when king Lamoni heard that Ammon was preparing his horses and his “chariots he was more astonished, because of the faithful- ness of Ammon, saying: Surely there has not been any servant among all my servants that has been so faith- ful as this man; for even he doth remember all my commandments to execute them.
11 Now I surely know that this is the Great Spirit, and I would desire
254
him that he come in unto me, but I durst not.
12 And it came to pass that when Ammon had made ready the horses and the chariots for the king and his servants, he went in unto the king, and he saw that the “countenance of the king was changed; therefore he was about to return out of his presence.
13 And one of the king’s servants said unto-him, *Rabbanah, whichis, being interpreted, powerful or great king, considering their kings to be powerful; and thus he said unto him: Rabbanah, the king desireth thee to stay.
14 Therefore Ammon turned him- self unto the king, and said unto him: What wilt thou that I should do for thee, O king? And the king answered him not for the space of an “hour, according to their time, for he knew not what he should say unto him.
15 And it came to pass that Ammon said unto him again: What desirest
| thou of me? But the king answered
him not.
16 And it came to pass that Am- mon, being filled with the “Spirit of God, therefore he perceived the >thoughts of the king. And he said unto him: Is it because thou hast heard that I defended thy servants and thy flocks, and slew ‘seven of their brethren with the sling and with the sword, and smote off the arms of others, in order to defend thy flocks and thy servants; behold, is it this that causeth thy marvel- ings?
17 I say unto you, what is it, that thy marvelings are so great ? Behold, I am a “man, and am thy servant; therefore, whatsoever thou desirest which is right, that will I do.
18 Now when the king had heard

these words, he marveled again, for he beheld that Ammon could “discern his thoughts; but not- withstanding this, king Lamoni did open his mouth, and said unto him: Who art thou? Art thou that Great Spirit, who knows all things?
19 Ammon answered and said unto him: I am not.
20 And the king said : How knowest thou the thoughts of my heart? Thou mayest speak boldly, and tell me concerning these things; and also tell me by what power ye slew and smote off the arms of my brethren that scattered my flocks—
21 And now, “if thou wilt tell me concerning these things, whatso- ever thou desirest I will give unto thee; and if it were needed, I would guard thee with my armies; but I know that thou art more powerful than all they; nevertheless, what- soever thou desirest of me I will grant it unto thee.
22 Now Ammon being “wise, yet harmless, he said unto Lamoni: Wilt thou hearken unto my words, if I tell thee by what power I do these things? And this is the thing that I desire of thee.
23 And the king answered him, and said: Yea, I “will believe all thy words. And thus he was caught with >suile.
24 And Ammon began to speak unto him with “boldness, and said unto him: Believest thou that there is a God?
25 And he answered, and said unto him: I do not know what that meaneth.
26 And then Ammon said: Believ- est thou that there is a *7Great Spirit ?
27 And he said, Yea.
28 And Ammon said: This is God.
ALMA 18:19-37
And Ammon said unto him again: Believest thou that this'Great Spirit, who is God, created all things which are in heaven and in the'earth?
29 And he said: Yea, I believe that he created all things which are in the earth; but I do not know the heavens.
30 And Ammon said unto him: The heavens is a place where God dwells and all his holy angels.
31 And king Lamoni said: Is it above the earth?
32 And Ammon said: Yea, and he looketh down upon all the children of men; and he “knows all the thoughts and “intents of the heart; for by his hand were they all created from the beginning.
33 And king Lamoni said: I believe all these things which thou hast spoken. Art thou “sent from God?
34 Ammon said unto him: Iama *man; and man in the beginning was created after the image of God, and Iam called by his Holy Spirit to teach these things unto this people, that they may be brought toa know- ledge of that which is just and true;
35 And a portion of that *Spirit dwelleth in me, which giveth me *’knowledge, and also power accord- ing to my faith and desires which are in God.
36 Now when Ammon had said these words, he began at the creation of the world, and also the creation of Adam, and told him all the things concerning’ the fall of man, and “rehearsed and laid before him the ’records and the holy scriptures of the people, which had been spoken by the ‘prophets, even down to the time that their father, Lehi, left Jerusalem.

them (for it was unto the king and to his servants) all the journeyings of their fathersin the wilderness, and all their sufferings with hunger and thirst, and their travail, and so forth.
38 And he also rehearsed unto them concerning the “rebellions of Laman and Lemuel, and the sons of Ishmael, yea, all their rebellions did he relate unto them; and he expounded unto them all the records and scriptures from the time that Lehi left Jeru- salem down to the present time.
39 But this is not all; for he %ex- pounded unto them the °plan of redemption, which was prepared from the foundation of the world; and he also made known unto them concerning the coming of Christ, and all the works of the Lord did he make known unto them.
40 And it came to pass that after he had said all these things, and ex- pounded them to the king, that the king “believed all his words.
41 And he began to cry unto the Lord, saying: O Lord, have mercy; according to thy abundant “mercy which thou hast had upon the people of Nephi, have upon me, and my people.
42 And now, when he had said this, he fell unto the earth, as if he were dead.
43 And it came to pass that his *¢servants took him and carried him in unto his wife, and laid him upon a bed; and he lay as if he were dead for the space of two days and two nights; and his wife, and his sons, and his daughters mourned over him, after the manner of the Laman- ites, greatly lamenting his loss.

AND it came to pass that after two days and two nights they were about to take his “body and lay it ina sepulchre, which they had made for the purpose of burying their dead.
2 Now the queen having heard of the fame of Ammon, therefore she sent and desired that he should come in unto her.
3 And it came to pass that Ammon did as he was commanded, and went in unto the queen, and desired to — what she would that he should

4 And she said unto him: The “servants of my husband have made it known unto me that thou art a >’prophet of a holy God, and that thou hast ‘power to do many mighty works in his name;

would that ye should go in and see my husband, for he has been laid upon his bed for the space of two days and two nights; and some say that he is not dead, but others say that he is dead and that he ¢stinketh, and that he ought to be placed in the sepulchre; but as for myself, to me he doth not stink.
6 Now, this was what Ammon desired, for he knew that king | Lamoni was under the power of God; he knew that the dark “veil of -unbelief was being cast away from his mind, and the ‘light which did light up his mind, which was the light of the glory of God, which was a marvelous light of his goodness— yea, this light had infused such joy into his soul, the cloud of darkness having been dispelled, and that the light of everlasting life was lit up in

257
his soul, yea, he knew that this had 4overcome his natural frame, and he was carried away in*God—
7 Therefore, what the queendesired of him was his only desire. There- fore, he went in to see the king according as the queen had desired him; and he saw the. king, and he knew that he was not dead:
8 And he said unto the queen: He is not dead, but he sleepeth in God, and on the morrow he shall rise again; therefore bury him not.
9 And Ammon said unto her: 2Believest thou this? And she said unto him: I have had no witness save thy word, and the word of our servants; nevertheless I °believe that it shall be according as thou hast said.
10 And Ammon said unto her: Blessed art thou because of thy exceeding faith; I say unto thee, woman, there has not been such great faith among all the people of the *Nephites.
11 And it came to pass that she watched over the bed of her hus- band, from that time even until that time on the morrow which Ammon had appointed that he should rise.
12 And it came to pass that he arose, according to the words of Ammon; and as he arose, he stretched forth his hand unto the woman, and said: Blessed be the name of God, and blessed art thou.
13 For as sure as thou livest, be- hold, I have “seen my Redeemer; and he shall come forth, and be®born of a “woman, and-he shall redeem all mankind who believe on his name, Now, when he had said these words, his heart was swollen within him, and he sunk again with joy; and the queen also sunk down, being overpowered by the Spirit.
14 Now Ammon seeing the Spirit

of the Lord poured out according to his “prayers upon the  Lamanites, his brethren, who had been the.cause of so much mourning among the Nephites, or among all the people of God because of their iniquities and their ’traditions, he. fell upon his knees, and began to pour out his soul in prayer and thanksgiving to God for what he had done for his breth- ren; and he was also overpowered with ‘joy; and thus they all three had _¢sunk to the earth.
15 Now, when the servants of the king had seen that they had fallen, they also began to cry unto God, for the fear of the Lord had come upon them also, for it was ‘they who had stood before the king and testified unto him concerning the great power of Ammon.
16 And it came to pass that they did call on the name of the Lord, in their might, even until they had all fallen to the earth, save it were one of the Lamanitish “women, whose name was Abish, she having been converted unto the Lord for many years, on account of a remarkable vision of her father—
17 Thus, having been converted to the Lord, and never having made it %known, therefore, when she saw that all the servants of Lamoni had ‘fallen to the earth, and also her mistress, the queen, and the king, and Ammon lay ‘prostrate upon the earth, she knew that it was the power of God; and supposing that this opportunity, by making known unto the people what had happened among them, that by beholding this scene it would “cause them to believe in the power of God, therefore she ran forth from house to house, making it known unto the people.
18 And they began to assemble themselves together unto the house

of the king. And there came a multitude, and to their_astonish- ment, they beheld the king, and the queen, and their servants prostrate upon the earth, and they all lay there as though they were dead; and they also saw Ammon, and behold, he was a Nephite.
19 And now the people began to murmur among themselves; some saying that it was a great evil that had come upon them, or upon the king and his house, because he had suffered that the Nephite should *remain in the land.
20 But others rebuked them, say- ing: The king hath brought this evil upon his house, because he slew his servants who-had had their flocks scattered at the ‘waters of Sebus.
21 And they were also rebuked by those men who had stood at the waters of Sebus and “scattered the flocks which belonged to the king, for they were angry with Ammon because of the number which he had slain of their brethren at the waters of Sebus, while defending the flocks of the king.
22 Now, one of them, whose brother had been “slain with the sword of Ammon, being exceedingly angry with Ammon, drew his sword and went forth that he might let it fall upon Ammon, to slay him; and as he lifted the sword to smite him, behold, he fell dead.
23 Now we see that Ammon could not be slain, for the “Lord had said unto Mosiah, his father: I will spare him, and it shall be unto him according to thy faith—therefore, Mosiah trusted him unto the Lord.
24 And it came to pass that when the multitude beheld that the man had fallen dead, who lifted the sword to slay Ammon, “fear came upon them all, and they durst not put forth their hands to touch him
258
or any of those who had fallen; and |
they began to marvel again among themselves what could be the cause
of this great power, or what all these |
things could mean.
25 And it came to pass that there ©
were many among them who said that Ammon was the °Great Spirit, and others said he was sent by the Great Spirit;
26 But others rebuked them all, saying that he was a “monster, who had been sent from the Nephites to torment them.
27 And there were some who said that Ammon was sent by the Great Spirit to afflict them because of their iniquities ; and that it was the Great Spirit that had always attended the Nephites, who had ever delivered them out of their hands; and they said that it was this Great Spirit who had destroyed so many of their brethren, the Lamanites.
28 And thus the contention began
them.. And while they were thus
‘to be exceedingly sharp: among |
contending, the “woman servant |
who had caused the multitude to be
gathered together came, and when |
she saw the contention which was among the multitude she was
exceedingly sorrowful, even unto |

“hand, that perhaps she might raise
her from the ground; and as soon as | she touched her hand she arose and | stood upon her feet, and cried witha | loud voice, saying: O blessed Jesus, |
who has saved me from an awful hell! O blessed God, have ‘mercy on this people!

Lamoni, by the hand, and behold he arose and stood upon his feet.
31 And he, immediately; seeing the contention among his people, went forth and began to rebuke them, and to teach them the “words which he had heard from the mouth of Ammon; and as many as heard his words believed, and were converted unto the Lord.
32 But there were “many among them who would not hear his words; therefore they went their way.
33 And it came to pass that when Ammon arose he also administered unto them, and also did all the servants of Lamoni; and they did all declare unto the people the self- same thing—that their hearts had been “changed; that they had no more desire to do "evil.
34 And behold, many did declare unto the people that they had ‘seen “angels and had conversed with them; and thus they had told them things of God, and of his righteous- ness. ‘
35. And it came to pass that there were many that did “believe in their words; and as many as did believe were baptized; and they became.a righteous people, and they did establish a church among them.
36 And thus the workof the Lord did commence among the Lamanites; thus the Lord did begin to pour out his ?Spirit upon them; and we see that his arm is extended to ’all people who will repent and believe on his name.

The Lord sends Ammon to Middoni to deliver his imprisoned brethren— Ammon and Lamoni meet Lamoni’s father, who is king over all the land— Ammon compels the old king to approve the release of his brethren.

AND it came to pass that when they had established a church in that “land, that king Lamoni desired that Ammon should go with him to the land of Nephi, that he might show him unto his father.
2 And the voice of the Lord came to Ammon, saying: Thou shalt not go up to the land of Nephi, for behold, the king will seek thy life; but thou shalt go to the land of "Middoni; for behold, thy brother Aaron, and also Muloki and Ammah are in prison.
3 Now it came to pass that when Ammon had heard this, he said unto Lamoni: Behold, my brother and brethren are in prison at Middoni, and I go that I may deliver them.
4 Now Lamoni said unto Ammon: I know, in the “strength of the Lord thou canst do all things. But behold, I will go with thee to the land of Middoni; for the king of the land of Middoni, whose name is Antiomno, is a friend unto me; therefore I go to the land of Middoni, that I may flatter the king of the land, and he will cast thy brethren out of prison. Now Lamoni said unto him: Who told thee that thy brethren were in prison?
5 And Ammon said unto him: No one hath told me, save it be God; and he said unto me—Go and deliver thy brethren, for they are in prison in the land of Middoni.
6 Now when Lamoni had heard this he caused that his servants should make ready his “horses and his chariots.
7 And he said unto Ammon: Come, I will go with thee down to the land of Middoni, and there I will plead with the king that he will cast thy brethren out of prison.
8 And it came to pass that as Ammon and Lamoni were journey-

ing thither, they met the father of Lamoni, who was king “over all the land.
9 And. behold, the father of Lamoni said unto him: Why did ye “not come to the ’feast on that great day when I made a feast unto my sons, and unto my people?
10 And he also said: Whither art thou going with this Nephite, who is one of the children of a “liar?
11 And it came to pass that Lamoni rehearsed unto him whither he was going, for he feared to offend him.
12 And he also told him all the cause of his tarrying in his own kingdom, that he did not go unto his father to the feast which he had prepared.
13 And now when Lamoni had rehearsed unto him all these things, behold, to his astonishment, his father was angry with him, and said: Lamoni, thou art going to deliver these Nephites, who are sons of a liar. Behold, he robbed our fathers; and now his children are also come amongst us that they may, by their cunning and their lyings, deceive us, that they again may rob us of our property.
14 Now the father of Lamoni com- manded him that he should slay Ammon with the sword. And he also commanded him that he should not go to the land of Middoni, but that he should return with him to the land of “Ishmael.
15 But Lamoni said unto him: I will not slay Ammon, neither will I return to the land of Ishmael, but I go to the land of Middoni that I may release the brethren of Ammon, for I know that they are just men and holy prophets of the true God.
16 Now when his father had heard these words, he was angry with him, and he drew his sword that he might smite him to the earth.

17 But Ammon stood forth and said unto him: Behold, thou shalt not slay thy son; nevertheless, it were *better that he should fall than thee, for behold, he: has ’repented of his sins; but if thou shouldst fall at this time, in thine anger, thy soul could not be saved.
18 And again, it is expedient that thou shouldst forbear; for if thou shouldst “slay thy son, he being an innocent man, his blood would cry from the ground to the Lord his God, for vengeance to come upon thee; and perhaps thou wouldst lose thy "soul.
19 Now when Ammon had said these words unto him, he answered him, saying: I know that if I should slay my son, that I should shed innocent blood; for it is thou that hast sought to destroy him.
20 And he stretched forth his hand to slay Ammon. But Ammon with- stood his blows, and also smote his arm that he could not use it.
21 Now when the king saw that Ammon could slay him, he began to plead with Ammon that he would spare his life.
22 But Ammon raised his sword, and said unto him: Behold, I will smite thee except thou wilt grant unto me that my brethren may be “cast out of prison.
23 Now the king, fearing he should lose his life, said: If thou wilt spare me I will grant unto thee whatso- ever thou wilt ask, even to half of the kingdom.
24 Now when Ammon saw that he had wrought upon the old king according to his desire, he said unto him: If thou wilt grant that my brethren may be cast out of prison, and also that Lamoni may retain his kingdom, and that ye be not dis- pleased with him, but grant that he may do according to his own desires in “whatsoever thing he thinketh,
23. 22a Alma 20: 4. 6. 24a Sete 21: 21 (21-22);
b D&C 42: 18.
[About 90 B.c.]
261
then will I spare thee; otherwise I will smite thee to the earth.
25 Now when Ammen had said these words, the king began to rejoice because of his life.
26 And when he saw that Ammon had no desire to destroy him, and when he also saw the great “love he had for his son Lamoni, he was astonished exceedingly, and: said: Because this is all that thou hast desired, that I would °release thy brethren, and suffer that my son Lamoni should retain his kingdom, behold, I will grant unto you that my son may retain his kingdom from this time and forever; and I will govern him no more—
27 And I will also grant unto thee that thy brethren may be cast out of prison, and thou and thy brethren may come unto me, in my kingdom; for I shall greatly desire to see thee. For the king was greatly astonished at the words which he had spoken, and also at the words which had been spoken by his son Lamoni, therefore he was “desirous to learn them.
28 And it came to pass that Am- mon and Lamoni proceeded on their journey towards the land of Middoni. And Lamoni found favor in the eyes of the king of the land; there- fore the brethren of Ammon were brought forth out of prison.
29 And when Ammon did meet them he was exceedingly sorrowful, for behold they were naked, and their skins were worn exceedingly because of being bound with strong cords. And they also had “suffered hunger, thirst, and all kinds of afflictions; nevertheless they were *natient in all their sufferings.
30 And, as it happened, it was their lot to have fallen into the hands of a more hardened and a more “stiff- necked people; therefore they would not hearken unto their words, and
ALMA 20:25-21:4
they had cast them out, and had smitten them, and had driven them from house to house, and from place to place, even until they had arrived in the land of Middoni; and there they were taken and cast into prison, and bound with ’strong cords, and kept in prison for many days, and were delivered by Lamoni and Ammon.

CHAPTER 21
Aaron teaches the Amalekites about Christ and his atonement— Aaron and his brethren are imprisoned in Middoni— After their deliverance they teach in the synagogues and make many converts—Lamoni grants re- ligious freedom to the people in the land of Ishmael.
Now when Ammon and his breth- ren “separated themselves in the borders of the land of the Lamanites, behold Aaron took his journey towards the land which was called by the Lamanites, °’ Jerusalem, call- ing it after the land of their fathers’ nativity; and it was away joining the borders of Mormon.
2 Now the Lamanites and the Amalekites and the people of *Amulon had built a great city, which was called Jerusalem.
3 Now the Lamanites of them- selves were sufficiently hardened, but the Amalekites and the Amu- lonites were still harder; therefore they did cause the Lamanites that they should harden their hearts, that they should wax strong in wickedness and their abominations.
4 And it came to pass that Aaron came to the city of Jerusalem, and

first began to preach to the Amale- kites. And he began to preach to them in their “synagogues, for they had _ built synagogues after the border of the Nehors; for many of the Amalekites and the Amulonites were after the order of the Nehors.
5 Therefore, as Aaron entered into | one of their “synagogues to preach unto the people, and as he was speak- ing unto them, behold there arose an Amalekite and began to contend with him, saying: What is that thou hast testified? Hast thou-seen an bangel? Why do not angels appear unto us? Behold “are not this people as good as thy people?
6 Thou also sayest, except we repent we shall perish. How knowest thou the thought and intent of our hearts? How knowest thou that we have cause to repent? How knowest thou that we are not a “righteous people? Behold, we have built *’sanctuaries, and we doassembleour- selves together to worship “God. We do believe that God willsaveallmen.
7 Now Aaron said unto him: Believest thou that the Son of God shall come to redeem mankind from their sins?
8 And the man said unto him: We do not “believe that thou knowest any such thing. We do not believe in these foolish traditions. We do not believe that thou knowest of things to come, neither do we believe that thy fathers and also that our fathers did know concerning the things which they spake, of that which is to come.
9 Now Aaron began to open the "scriptures unto. them concerning the coming of Christ, and also. con- cerning the resurrection of the dead, and that there could be ’no redemp- tion for mankind ‘save it were

through the ‘death and sufferings of Christ, and the atonement of his blood.
10 And it came to pass as he began to expound these things unto them they were angry with him, and began to*mock him; and they would not hear the words which he spake.
11 Therefore, when he saw that they would not hear his words, he departed out of their synagogue, and came over toa village which was called Ani-Anti, and there he found Muloki preaching the word unto them; and also Ammah and _ his brethren. And they contended with many about the word.
12 And it came to pass that they saw that the people would harden their hearts, therefore they departed and came over into the land of *Middoni. And they did preach the word unto many, and °few believed on the words which they taught.
13 Nevertheless, Aaron and a certain number of his brethren were taken and cast into “prison, and the remainder of them fled out of the land of Middoni unto the regions round about.
14 And those who were cast into prison “suffered many things, and they were delivered by the hand of Lamoni and Ammon, and they were fed and clothed.
15 And they went forth again to declare the word, and. thus they were delivered forthe first time out of prison; and thus they had suffered.
16 And they went forth whither- soever they were led by the ?Spirit of the Lord, preaching the word of God in every synagogue of the Amale- kites, or in every assembly of the Lamanites where they could be admitted.
17 And it came to pass that the

Lord began to bless them, insomuch that they brought many to the knowledge of the truth; yea, they did “convince many of their sins, and of the traditions of their fathers, which were not correct.
18 And it came to pass that Ammon and Lamoni returned-from the land of Middoni to the land of “Ishmael, which was the land of their inheri- tance.
19 And king Lamoni would not suffer that Ammon should servehim, or be his “servant.
20 But he caused that there should be “synagogues built in the land of Ishmael; and he caused that his people, or the people who were under his reign, should assemble them- selves together.
21 And he did rejoice over them, and he did teach them many things. And he did also declare unto them that they were a people who were under him, and that they were a “free people, that they were free from the oppressions of the king, his father; for that his father had granted unto him that he might reign over the people who were in the land of Ishmael, and in all the land round about.
22 And he also declared unto them that they might have the “liberty of worshiping the Lord their God according to their desires, in what- soever place they were in, if it were in the land which was under the reign of king Lamoni.
23 And Ammon did preach unto the people of king Lamoni; and it came to pass that he did teach them all things concerning things pertain- ing to righteousness. And he did exhort them daily, with all diligence ; and they gave heed unto his word, and they were “zealous for keeping the commandments of God.
ALMA 21:18-22:5
CHAPTER 22
Aaron teaches Lamoni’s father about the creation, the fall of Adam, and the plan of redemption through Christ— The king and all his household are converted—How the land was divided wesnned the Nephites and the Laman- ites.
Now, as Ammon was thus teaching the people of Lamoni continually, we will return to the account of Aaron and his brethren; for after he departed from the land of Middoni he was “led by the Spirit to the land of Nephi, even to the house of the king which was "over all the land °save it were the land of Ishmael; and he was the father of Lamoni.
2 And it came to pass that he went in unto him into the king’s palace, with his brethren, and bowed him- self before the king, and said unto him: Behold, O king, we are the brethren of Ammon, whom thou hast “delivered out of "prison.
3 And now, O king, if thou wilt spare our lives, we will be thy servants. And the king said unto them: Arise, for I will grant unto you your lives, and I will not suffer that ye shall be my servants; but I will insist that ye shall administer unto me; for I have been somewhat “troubled in mind because of the >senerosity and the greatness of the words of thy brother Ammon; and I desire to know the cause why he has not come up out of Middoni with thee.
4 And Aaron said unto the king: Behold, the Spirit of the Lord has called him another way; he has gone “to the land of Ishmael, to teach the people of Lamoni.
5 Now the king said unto them: What is this that ye have said con- cerning the Spirit of the Lord?

Behold, this is the thing which doth trouble me. ;
6 And also, what is this that Am- mon said—‘If ye will repent ye shall be saved, and if ye will not repent, ye shall be cast off at the last day?
7 And Aaron answered him and said unto him: Believest thou that there is a God? And the king said: I know that the Amalekites say that there is a God, and I have granted unto them that they should build sanctuaries, that they may assemble themselves together to worship him. And if now thou sayest there is. a God, behold I will “believe.
8 And now when Aaron heard this, his heart began to rejoice, and he said: Behold, assuredly as thou livest, O king, there is a God.
9. And the king said: Is God that “Great Spirit that brought our fathers out of the land of Jerusalem?
10 And Aaron said unto him: Yea, he is that Great Spirit, and he *created all things both in heaven and in earth. Believest thou this?
11 And he said: Yea, I believe that the Great Spirit created all things, and I desire that ye should tell me concerning all these things, and I will “believe thy words.
12 And it came to pass that when Aaron. saw that the king would believe his words, he began from the creation of Adam, “reading the scriptures unto the king—how God *created man after his own image, and that God gave him command- ments, and that because of trans- gression, man had fallen.
13 And Aaron did expound unto him the scriptures from the “crea- tion of Adam, laying the fall of man

faith and repentance, and so forth; |
and that he breaketh the bands of death, that the °’grave shall have
no victory, and that the sting of |
death should be swallowed up in the hopes of glory; and Aaron did expound all these things unto the king.
15 And it came to pass that after |
Aaron had expounded these things unto him, the king said: 7What shall I do that I may have this eternal life of which thou hast spoken? Yea, what shall I do that I may be ’born of God, having this wicked spirit ‘rooted out of my breast, and receive his Spirit, that I may be filled with joy, that I may not be cast off at the last day ?

prostrate himself upon the earth, and cried ’mightily, saying:
18 O God, Aaron hath told me that there is a God; and if there is a God, and if thou art God, wilt thou make thyself known unto me, and I will give away all my sins to know thee, and that I may be raised from the dead, and be saved at the last day. And now when the king had said these words, he was struck @as if he were dead.
19 And it came to pass that his servants ran and told the queen all that had happened unto the king. And she came in unto the king; and when she saw him lay as if he were dead, and also Aaron and_ his brethren standing as though they had been the cause of his fall, she was angry with them, and com- manded that her servants, or the servants of the king, should take them and slay them.
20 Now the servants had seen the cause of the king’s fall, therefore they durst not lay their hands on Aaron and his brethren; and they pled with the queen saying: Why commandest thou that we should slay these men, when behold one of them is “mightier than us all? There- fore we shall fall before them.
21 Now when the queen saw the fear of the servants she also began to fear exceedingly, lest there should some evil come upon her. And she commanded her servants that they should go and call the people, that they might slay Aaron and his brethren.
22 Now when Aaron saw the determination of the queen, he, also knowing the hardness of the hearts of the people, feared lest that a multitude should assemble them- selves together, and there should be a great contention and a disturbance among them; therefore he put forth
his “hand and raised the king from the earth, and said unto him: Stand. And he stood upon his feet, receiv- ing his strength.
23. Now this was done in the presence of the queen and many of the servants. And when they saw it they greatly marveled, and began to fear. And the king stood forth, and began to *minister unto them. And he did minister unto them, insomuch that his ’whole household were “con- verted unto the Lord.
24 Now there was a multitude gathered together because of the commandment of the queen, and there began to be great murmurings among them because of Aaron and his brethren.
25 But the king stood forth among them and administered unto them. And they were “pacified towards Aaron and those who were with him.
26 And it came to pass that when the king saw that the people were pacified, he caused that Aaron and his brethren should stand forthin the midst of the multitude, and that they should preach the word unto them.
27 And it came.to pass that. the king sent a “proclamation through- out all the land, amongst all his people who were in all his land, who were in all the regions round about, which was bordering even to the sea, on the east and on the west, and which was divided from the land of °‘Zarahemla by a narrow strip of wilderness, which ran from the sea east even to the sea west, and round about.on the borders of the sea- shore, and the borders of the wilder- ness which was on the north by the land of Zarahemla, through the borders of 7Manti, by the head of the ‘river Sidon, running from the east towards the west—and thus were the Lamanites and the Nephites divided.

28 Now, the more “idle part of the Lamanites lived in the wilderness, and dwelt in tents; and they were spread through the wilderness on the west, in the land of Nephi; yea, and also on the west of the land of Zarahemla, in the borders by the seashore, and on the west in the land of Nephi, in the place of their fathers’ first inheritance, and thus bordering along by the seashore.
29 And also there were many Lamanites on the east by the sea- shore, whither the Nephites had driven them. And thus the Nephites were nearly surrounded by the Lamanites; nevertheless the Ne- phites had taken possession of all the northern parts of the land bordering on the wilderness, at the head of the river Sidon, from the east to the west, round about on the wilderness side; on the north, even until they came to the land which they called *Bountiful.
30 And it bordered upon the land which they called *Desolation, it being so far northward that it came into the land which had been peopled and been destroyed, of whose bones we have spoken, which was discovered by the ‘people of Zarahemla, it being the place of their “first landing.
31 And they came from there “up into the south wilderness. Thus the ‘land on the northward was called *Desolation, and the land on the southward was called Bountiful, it being the wilderness which is filled with all manner of wild animals of every kind, a part of which had come from the land northward for food.
32 And now, it was only the “distance of a day and a half’s journey for a Nephite, on the line Bountiful and the land Desolation, from the east to the west sea; and

thus the land of Nephi and the land of Zarahemla were nearly sur- rounded by water, there being a small *neck of land between the land northward and the land southward.
33 And it came to pass that the Nephites had inhabited the land Bountiful, even from the east unto the west sea, and thus the Nephites in their wisdom, with their guards and their armies, had hemmed in the Lamanites on the south, that there- by they should have no more possession on the north, that they might not overrun the land north- ward.
34 Therefore the Lamanites could have no more possessions only in the land of Nephi, and the wilder- ness round about. Now this was wisdom in the Nephites—as the Lamanites were an enemy to them, they would not suffer their afflic- tions on every hand, and also that they might have a country whither they might flee, according to their desires.
35 And now I, after having said | this, return again to the account of Ammon and Aaron, Omner and Himni, and their brethren.

BEHOLD, now it came to pass that the king of the Lamanites sent a “proclamation among all his people, that they should not lay their hands on Ammon, or Aaron, or Omner, or Himni, nor either of their brethren who should go forth preaching the word of God, in whatsoever place

they should be, in any part of their land.
2 Yea, he sent a decree among them, that they should not lay their hands on them to bind them, or to cast them into prison; neither should they spit upon them, nor smite them, nor cast them out of their "synagogues, nor scourge them; neither should they cast stones at them, but that they should have free access to their houses, and also their temples, and their sanctuaries.
3 And thus they might go forth and preach the word according to their desires, for the king had been con- verted unto the Lord, and “all his *household; therefore he sent. his proclamation throughout the land unto his people, that the word of God might have no obstruction, but that it might go forth throughout all the land, that his people might be convinced concerning the wicked °traditions of their fathers, and that they might be convinced that they were all brethren, and that they ought not to murder, nor to plunder, nor to steal, nor to commit adultery, nor to commit any manner. of wickedness.
4 And now it came to pass that when the king had sent forth this proclamation, that Aaron and _ his brethren went forth from “city to city, and from one house of worship to another, establishing churches, and consecrating °priests and teach- ers throughout the land among the Lamanites, to preach and to teach the word of God among them; and thus they began to have great success.
5 And “thousands were brought to the knowledge of the Lord, yea, thousands were brought to believe

in. the traditions of the Nephites; and they were taught the ‘records and prophecies which were handed down even to the present time.
6 And.as sure.as the Lord liveth, so sure as many as believed, or as many as were brought to the knowledge of the truth, through the preaching of Ammon and his brethren, according to the spirit of revelation and of prophecy, and the power of God working “miracles in them—yea, I say unto you, as the Lord liveth, as many of the Lamanites as believed in their preaching, and were °con- verted unto the Lord, ‘never did fall away.
7 For they became a righteous people; they did lay down the weapons of their rebellion, that they did not fight against God any more, neither against any of their breth- ren.
8 Now, these are *they who were converted unto the Lord:
9° The people of the Lamanites who were in the land of Ishmael;
10 And also of the people of the Lamanites who were in the land of *Middoni;
11 And also of the people of the Lamanites who were in the city of Nephi;
12 And also of the people of the Lamanites who were in the land of *Shilom, and who were in the land of Shemlon, and in the city of Lemuel, and in the city of Shimnilom.
13 And these are the names of the cities of the Lamanites which were “converted unto the Lord; and these are they that laid down the weapons of their rebellion, yea, all their weapons.of war; and they were all Lamanites. "

“converted, save only one; neither were any of the "Amulonites; but they did harden their hearts, and also the hearts of the Lamanites in that part of the land wheresoever they dwelt, yea, and all their villages and all their cities.
15 Therefore, we have named all the cities of the Lamanites in which they did repent and come to the knowledge of the truth, and were converted.
16 And now it came to pass that the king and those who were converted were desirous that they might have a name, that thereby they might be distinguished from their brethren; therefore the king consulted with Aaron and many of their priests, concerning the name that they should take upon them, that they might be distinguished.
17 And it came to pass that they called their names 7Anti-Nephi- Lehies; and they were called by this name and were no more called >Lamanites.
18 And they began to be a very “industrious people; yea, and they were friendly with the Nephites; therefore, they did open a corre- spondence with them, and the ‘curse of God did no more follow them.
all the land round about, who had
not been converted and had not
taken upon them the name of 4Anti-Nephi-Lehi, were stirred up |} by the Amalekites and by the |}
Amulonites to anger against their jj
brethren. |
2 And their hatred became exceed- | ingly sore against them, even in- | somuch that they began to rebel | against their king, insomuch that | they would not that he should be } their king; therefore, they took up | arms against the people of Anti- |
Nephi-Lehi.
3 Now the king conferred the king- | dom upon his son, and he called his | name Anti-Nephi-Lehi. |
4 And the king died in that self- same year that the Lamanites began | tomake preparations for war against | the people of God.
5 Now when Ammon and his | brethren and all those who had come
_up with him saw the preparations of the Lamanites to destroy their brethren, they came forth to the land of Midian, and there Ammon met allhis brethren; and from thence they came to the land of Ishmael that they might hold a “council with Lamoni and also with his brother Anti-Nephi-Lehi, what they should do to defend themselves against the || Lamanites.
6 Now there was not one soul among all the people who had been || converted unto the Lord that would | take up arms against their brethren; nay, they would not even make any preparations for war; yea, and also their king commanded them that they should not.
7 Now, these are the words which he said unto the people concerning the matter: I thank my God, my beloved people, that our great God | has in goodness sent these our brethren, the Nephites, unto us te |
CHAPTER 24
The Lamanites come against the people of God—The Anti-Nephi- Lehies rejoice in Christ and are visited by angels—They choose to suffer death rather than to defend themselves—More Lamanites are con- verted.

preach unto us, and to convince us of the “traditions of our wicked fathers.
8 And behold, I thank my great God that he has given us a portion of his Spirit to soften our hearts, that we have “opened a correspondence with these brethren, the Nephites.
9 And behold, I alsothank my God, that by opening this correspondence we have been convinced of our “sins, and of the many murders which_we have committed.
10 And I also thank my God, yea, my great God, that he hath granted unto us that we might repent of these things, and also that he hath *forgiven us of those our many sins and murders which we have com- mitted, and taken away the "guilt from our hearts, through the merits of his Son.
11 And now behold, my brethren, since it has been all that we could do, (as we were the most lost of all mankind) to repent. of all our sins and the many murders which we have committed, and to get God to "take them away from our hearts, for it was all we could do to repent sufficiently before God that he would take away our stain—
12 Now, my best beloved brethren, since God hath taken away our stains, and our swords have become bright, then let us stain our swords no more with the blood of our brethren.
13 Behold, I say unto you, Nay, let us retain our swords that they be not stained with the blood of our brethren; for perhaps, if we should stain our swords “again they can no more be washed bright through the blood of the Son of our great God, which shall be shed for the atonement of our sins.
14 And the great God has had mercy on us, and made these things

known. unto us that we might not perish; yea, and he has made these things known unto us beforehand, because he loveth our @souls as well as he loveth our children; therefore, in his mercy he doth visit us by his angels, that the "plan of salvation might be made known unto us as well as unto future generations,
15 Oh, how merciful is our God! And now behold, since it has been as much as we could do to get our stains taken away from us, and our swords are made bright, let us “hide them away that they may be kept bright, as a testimony to our God at the last day, or at the day that we shall be brought to stand before him to be judged, that we have not stained our swords in the blood of our brethren since he imparted his word unto us and has made us °clean thereby.
16 And now, my brethren, if our brethren. seek to destroy us, behold, we will hide away our swords, yea, even we will bury them deep in the earth, that they may be kept bright, as a testimony that we have never used them, at the last day; and if our brethren destroy us, behold, we shall “go to our God and shall be saved.
17 And now it came to pass that when the king had made an end of these sayings, and all the people were assembled together, they took their swords, and all the weapons which were used for the shedding of man’s blood, and they did °bury them up deep in the earth.
18 And this they did, it being in their view a testimony to God, and also to men, that they “never would use weapons again for the shedding of man’s blood; and this they did, vouching and 2°covenanting with God, that rather than shed the

ALMA 24:19-30
blood of their brethren they would °give up their own lives; and rather than take away from a brother they would give unto him; and rather than spend their days in idleness they would labor abundantly with their hands.
19 And thus we see that, when these Lamanites were brought to “believe and to know the truth, they were firm, and would suffer even unto death rather than commit sin; and thus we see that they buried their weapons of peace, or they buried the weapons of war, for peace.
20 And it came to pass that their brethren, the Lamanites, made prep- arations for war, and came up to the land of Nephi for the purpose of destroying the king, and to place ®another in his stead, and also of destroying the people of Anti- Nephi-Lehi out of the land.
21 Now when the people saw that they were coming against them they went out to meet them, and “pros- trated themselves before them to the earth, and began to call on the name of the Lord; and thus they were in this attitude when the Laman- ites began to fall upon them, and began to slay them with the sword.
22 And thus without meeting any resistance, they did slay a °thousand and five of them; and we know that they are blessed, for they have gone to dwell with their God.
23 Now when the Lamanites saw that their brethren would not flee from the sword, neither would they turn aside to the right hand or to the left, but that they would lie down and “perish, and "praised God even in the very act of perishing under the sword—

this they did “forbear from slaying them; and there were many whose hearts had swollen in them for those of their brethren who had fallen under the sword, for they repented of the things which they had done.
25 And it came to pass that they threw down their weapons of war, and they would not take them again, for they were stung for the murders which they had com- mitted; and they came down even as their brethren, relying upon the mercies of those whose arms were lifted to slay them.
26 And it came to pass that the people of God were joined that day by more than the number who had been slain; and those who had been slain were righteous people, there- fore we have no reason to doubt but what they were “saved.
27 And there was not a wicked man slain among them; but there were more than a thousand brought to the knowledge of the truth; thus we see that the Lord worketh in many 2ways to the salvation of his people.
28 Now the greatest number of those of the Lamanites who slew so many of their brethren were Amale- kites and Amulonites, the greatest number of whom were after the *order of the ’Nehors.
29 Now, among those who joined the people of the Lord, there were “none who were Amalekites or Amulonites, or who were of the order of Nehor, but they were actual descendants of Laman and Lemuel.
30 And thus we can plainly discern, that after a people have been once “enlightened by the °Spirit of God, and have had great “knowledge of things pertaining to righteousness, and then have “fallen away into |

CHAPTER 25
Lamanite aggressions spread—The seed of the priests of Noah perish as Abinadi prophesied—Many Laman- ites are converted and join the people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi—They believe in Christ and keep the law of Moses.
AND behold, now it came to pass that. those Lamanites were more angry because they had slain their brethren; therefore. they swore vengeance upon the Nephites; and they did “no more attempt to slay the people of °Anti-Nephi-Lehi at that time.
2 But they took their armies and went over into the borders of the land of Zarahemla, and fell upon the people who were in the land of Ammonihah and “destroyed them.
3 And after that, they had “many battles with the Nephites, in the which they were driven and slain.
4 And among the Lamanites who were slain were almost all the *seed of Amulon and his brethren, who were the priests of Noah, and they were slain by the hands of the Nephites ;
5 And the remainder, having fled into the east wilderness, and having usurped the power and “authority over the Lamanites, caused that many of the Lamanites should ‘perish by fire because of their belief—
6 For many of “them, after having suffered much loss and so many afflictions, began to be stirred up in remembrance of the ’words which Aaron and his brethren had

preached to them in their land; therefore they began to disbelieve the ‘traditions of their fathers, and to believe in the Lord, and that he gave great power unto the Nephites; and thus there were many of them converted in the wilderness.
7 And it came to pass that those rulers who were the remnant of the children of *Amulon caused that they should be put to °death, yea, all those that believed in these things.
8 Now this martyrdom caused that many of their brethren should be stirred up to anger; and there began to be contention in the wilderness; and the Lamanites began to “hunt the seed of Amulon‘and his brethren and began to slay them; and they fled into the east wilderness.
9 And behold they are hunted at this day by the Lamanites. Thus the words of Abinadi were brought to pass, which he said concerning the seed of the priests who’ caused that he should suffer death by fire.
10 For he‘said unto them: What ye shall ?do unto me shall be a type of things to come.
11 And now Abinadi was the first that suffered “death by fire because of his belief in God ; now this is what he meant, that many should suffer death by fire, according as he had suffered.
12 And he said unto the priests of Noah that their seed should cause many to be put to death, in the like manner as he was, and that they should be scattered abroad and slain, even as a sheep having no shepherd is driven and slain by wild beasts ; and now behold, these words were verified, for they were driven by the Lamanites, and they were hunted, and they were smitten.

the Lamanites saw that they could not overpower the Nephites they returned again to their own land; and many of them came over to dwell in the land of ?Ishmael and the land of Nephi, and did join themselves to the people of God, who were the people of ’Anti-Nephi- Lehi.
14 And they did also “bury their weapons of war, according as their brethren had, and they began to bea righteous people; and they did walk in the ways of the Lord, and did observe to keep his commandments and his statutes.
15 Yea, and they did keep the law of Moses; for it was expedient that they should keep the law of Moses as yet, for it was not all fulfilled. But notwithstanding the “law of Moses, they did look forward to the coming of Christ, considering that the law of Moses was a ’type of his coming, and believing that they must keep those ‘outward “per- formances until the time that he should be revealed unto them.
16 Now they did not suppose that “salvation came by the law of Moses; but the law of Moses did serve to strengthen their faith in Christ; and thus they did retain a ‘hope through faith, unto eternal salvation, relying upon the spirit of prophecy, which spake of. those things to come.
17.And now behold, Ammon, and Aaron, and Omner, and Himni, and their brethren did rejoice exceed- ingly, for the success which they had had among the Lamanites, seeing that the Lord had granted unto them according to their

Ammon glories in the Lord—The faithful are strengthened by the Lord and are given knowledge—By faith men may bring thousands of souls unto repentance—God has all power and comprehendeth all things.
AND now, these are the words of | Ammon to his brethren, which say | thus: My brothers and my brethren, behold I say unto you, how great reason have we to rejoice; for could we have supposed when we “started from the land of Zarahemla that God would have granted unto us such great blessings?
2 And now, I ask, what great blessings has he bestowed upon us? Can ye tell?
3 Behold, I answer for you; for our brethren, the Lamanites, were in darkness, yea, even in the darkest abyss, but behold, how ‘many of them are brought to behold the marvelous light of God! And this is the blessing which hath been bestowed upon us, that we have been made "instruments in the hands of God to bring about this great work.

7 But behold, they are in the hands of the Lord of the “harvest, and they are his; and he will raise them up at the last day.
8 “Blessed be the name of our God; let us ’sing to his praise, yea, let us give ‘thanks to his holy name, for he doth work righteousness forever.
9 For if we had not come up out of the land of Zarahemla, these our dearly beloved brethren, who have so dearly beloved us, would still have been racked with “hatred against us, yea, and they would also have been °’strangers to God.
10 And it came to pass that when Ammon had said these words, his brother Aaron rebuked him, saying: Ammon, I fear that thy joy doth carry thee away unto boasting.
11 But Ammon said unto him: I do not ?boast in my own strength, nor in my own wisdom; but behold, my “joy is full, yea, my heart is brim with ‘joy, and I will rejoice in my God.

13 Behold, how many thousands of our brethren has he loosed from the pains of “hell; and they are brought to sing redeeming love, and this because of the power of his word which is in us, therefore have we not great reason to rejoice?
14 Yea, we have reason to praise him forever, for he is the Most High God, and has loosed our brethren from the “chains of hell.
15 Yea, they were encircled about with everlasting ‘darkness and destruction; but behold, he has brought them into his everlasting ‘light, yea; into everlasting salva- tion; and they are encircled about with the matchless bounty of his love; yea, and we have been instru- ments in his hands of doing this great and marvelous work.

19 Oh then, why did he not con- sign us to an awful destruction, yea, why did he not let the sword of his justice fall upon us, and doom us to eternal “despair?
20 Oh, my soul, almost as it were, fleeth at the thought. Behold, he did not exercise his justice upon us, but in his great mercy hath brought us over that everlasting “gulf of death and misery, even to the salva- tion of our souls.
21 And now behold, my brethren, what “natural man is there that knoweth these things? I say unto you, there is "none that ‘knoweth these things, save it be the penitent.

23 Now do ye remember, my brethren, that we said unto our brethren in the land of Zarahemla, we go up to the land of Nephi, to preach unto our brethren, the Lamanites, and they “laughed us to scorn?
24 For they said unto us: Do ye suppose that ye can bring the Lamanites to the knowledge of the truth? Do ye suppose that ye can convince the Lamanites of the “in- correctness of the ’traditions of their
274 ||
fathers, as ‘stiffnecked a people as
they are; whose hearts delight in the —
4shedding of blood; whose days have
been spent in the grossest iniquity; |
whose ways have been the ways.of a transgressor from the beginning?
Now my brethren, ye remember |
that this was their language. 25 And moreover they did say:
| Let us take up arms against them,
that we destroy them and their iniquity out of the land, lest they overrun us and-destroy us.
26 But behold, my beloved breth- |
ren, we came into the wilderness not with the intent to destroy our
brethren, but with the intent that ||
perhaps we might save some few of their souls. 27 Now when our hearts were
depressed, and we were about to |
“turn back, behold, the Lord °com-
forted us, and said: Go amongst thy | brethren, the Lamanites, and bear | with ‘patience thine “afflictions,
and I will give unto you success.
28 And now behold, we have come, and been forth amongst them; and we have been patient in our suffer- ings, and we have suffered every privation; yea, we have traveled from house to house, relying upon the mercies of the world—not upon the mercies of the world alone but upon the mercies of God.
29 And we have entered into their ||
houses and taught them, and we have taught them in their streets; yea, and we have taught them upon
their hills; and we have also entered |
into their temples and their “syna- gogues and taught them; and we
have been cast out, and mocked, |
and spit upon, and smote upon our

~30 And we have suffered all manner of afflictions, and all this, ‘that perhaps we might be the means of Saving some soul; and we supposed that our “joy would be full if perhaps wecould bethe means ofsavingsome.
31 Now behold, we can look forth and see the “fruits of our labors; and are they few? I say unto you, Nay, they are "many; yea, and we can witness of their sincerity, because of their love towards their brethren and also towards us.
32 For behold, they had rather "sacrifice their lives than even to take the life of their enemy; and they have ’buried their weapons of war deep in the earth, because of their love towards their brethren.
33 And now behold I say unto you, has there been so great love in all the land? Behold, I say unto you, Nay, there has not, even among the Nephites.
34 For behold, they would take up arms against their brethren; they would: not suffer themselves to be slain. But behold how“many of these have laid down their lives; and we know that they have gone to their God, because of their love and of their hatred to sin.
35 Now have we not reason to rejoice? Yea, I say unto you, there never were men that had so great reason to rejoice aS we, since the world began; yea, and my joy is carried away, even unto boasting in my God; for he has all “power, ball wisdom, and all understanding; he comprehendeth all things, and

he is a ‘merciful Being; even unto salvation, to those who will repent and believe on his name.
36 Now if this. is “boasting, even so will I boast; for this is my life‘and my. light, my joy and my salvation, and my redemption from everlasting wo. Yea, blessed is the name of my God, who: has been mindful of this people, who are a branch of the tree of Israel, and has been ‘lost from its body in a strange land; yea, I say, blessed be the name of my God, who has. been mindful: of | us, 4wanderers in a strange land.
37 Now my brethren, we see that God is “mindful ‘of every people, whatsoever land they may be in; yea, he numbereth his people, and his bowels of mercy are over all the earth. Now this is my joy, and my great thanksgiving; yea, and I will give thanks unto my God forever. Amen.
CHAPTER 27
The Lord commands Ammon to lead the people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi to safety—Upon meeting. Alma, Am- mon’s joy exhausts his strength—The Nephites give them the land of Jershon—They are called the people of Ammon.
Now it came to pass that when those Lamanites who had gone to war against. the’ Nephites had found, after their “many struggles to destroy them, that it was in vain to seek their destruction, they returned again to the land of Nephi.
2 And it came to pass that the Amalekites, because of their loss, were exceedingly angry. And when they saw that they could not seek revenge from the Nephites, they began to “stir up the people in anger

against their °brethren, the people of “Anti-Nephi-Lehi; therefore they began again to destroy them:
3. Now this people ?again refused to take their arms, and they suffered themselves to be slain according to the desires of their enemies.
4 Now when Ammon and _ his brethren saw this work of destruc- tion among those whom they so dearly beloved, and among those who had so dearly beloved them— for they were treated as though they were angels sent from God to save them from everlasting destruc- tion—therefore, when Ammon and his brethren saw this great work of destruction, they were moved with compassion, and they “said unto the king:
5 Let us gather together this people of the Lord, and let-us go down to the land of Zarahemla to our breth- ren the Nephites, and flee out of the hands of our enemies, that we be not destroyed.
6 But the king said unto them: Behold, the Nephites will destroy us, because of the many murders and sins. we have committed against them.
7 And Ammon said: I will go and inquire of the Lord, and if he say unto us, go down unto our brethren, will ye go?
8 And the king said unto him: Yea, if the Lord saith unto us go, we will go down unto our brethren, and we will be their slaves until we repair unto them the many murders and sins which we have committed against them.
9 But Ammon said unto him: It is against the law of our brethren, which was established by my father, that there should be any “slaves among them; therefore let us go down and rely upon the mercies of our brethren.
10 But the king said unto him: Inquire of the Lord, and if he saith ©
unto us go, we will go; otherwise we —
will perish in the land.
11 And it came topass that Ammon —
went and inquired of the Lord, and | the Lord said unto him:
12 Get this people “out of this anes that they perish not; for Satan has great hold on the hearts of the Amalekites, who do stir up the
Lamanites to anger against their ‘|
brethren to slay them; therefore get thee out of this land; and blessed are this people in this generation, for I will "preserve them.
i]
13 And now it came to pass that .
Ammon went and told the king all
the words which the Lord had said |
unto him. 14 And they gathered together: all their people, yea, all the people of
the Lord, and did gather together |
all their flocks and herds, and
-departed out of the land, and came
into the wilderness which divided
the land of Nephi from the land of |
Zarahemla, and came over near the borders of the land.
15 Andit came to pass that Ammon said unto them: Behold, I and my brethren will go forth into the land of Zarahemla, and ye shall remain here until we return; and we will “try the hearts of our brethren,
whether they will that ye shall come |
into their land. 16 And it came to pass that as Ammon was going forth into the
land, that he and his brethren met |
Alma, over in the “place of which has been spoken; and behold, this was a joyful meeting.
17 Now the “joy of Ammon was so great even that he was full; yea, he
was swallowed up in the joy of his |
God, even to the "exhausting of his strength; and he fell ‘again to the earth.

18 Now was not this ‘exceeding joy? Behold, this is joy.which none receiveth save it be the truly penitent and humble seeker of “happiness.
19 Now the joy of Alma in meeting his “brethren was truly great, and also the joy of Aaron, of Omner, and Himni; but behold their joy was not that to exceed their strength.
20 And now it came to pass that Alma conducted his brethren back to the land of Zarahemla; even to his ?own house. And they went and told the °chief judge all the things that had happened unto them in the land of Nephi, among. their brethren, the Lamanites.
21 And it came to pass that the chief judge. sent a proclamation throughout all the land, desiring the. voice of the people concerning the admitting their brethren, who were the people of “Anti-Nephi-Lehi.
22 And it came to pass that the voice of the people came, saying: Behold, we will give up the “land of >Jershon, which is on the east-by the sea, which joins the land Bountiful, which is on the south of the land Bountiful; and this land Jershon is the land which we will give unto our brethren for an inheritance.
23 And behold, we will set. our armies between the land Jershon and the land Nephi, that we may
_ "protect our brethren in the land
Jershon; and this we do for our brethren, on account of their fear to take up arms against their brethren lest they should commit
| sin; and this their great fear came
because of their sore repentance which they had, on account of their many murders and their awful
' wickedness.

unto our brethren, that they may inherit the land Jershon; and we will guard them from their enemies with our armies, on condition that they will give us a “portion of their sub- stance to assist us that we may maintain our armies.
25 Now, it came to pass that when Ammon had heard this, he returned to the people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi, and also Alma with him, into the wilderness, where they had pitched their tents, and made known unto them all these things. And Alma also related unto them his “conversion, with Ammon and Aaron, and his brethren.
26 And it came to pass that it did cause great joy among them. And they went down into the land of Jershon, and took possession of the land of Jershon; and they were called by the Nephites the “people of Ammon; therefore they were distinguished by that name ever after.
27 And they were among the people of Nephi, and also numbered among the people who were of the church of God. And they were also distinguished for their ¢zeal towards God, and also towards. men; for they. were perfectly "honest and up- right in all things; and they were firm in the faith of Christ, even unto the end.
28 And they did look upon shed- ding the blood of their brethren with the greatest abhorrence; and they never could be prevailed upon to take up arms against their brethren; and they never did look upon death with any degree of terror, for their hope and views of Christ and the resurrection; therefore, death was swallowed up to them by the victory of Christ over it.
29 Therefore, they would, suffer

“death in the most aggravating and distressing manner which could be inflicted by their brethren, before they would take the sword or cimeter to smite them. ;

CHAPTER 28
The Lamanites are. defeated in a tremendous battle—Tens of thousands are slain—The wicked are consigned to a state of endless woe; the righteous attain a never-ending happiness.
AND now it came to pass that after the people of Ammon were estab- lished in the land of “Jershon, and a church also established in the land of Jershon, and the armies of the Nephites were set round about the land of Jershon, yea, in all the borders round about the land of Zarahemla; behold the armies of the Lamanites had followed their breth- ren into the wilderness.
2 And thus there was a tremendous battle; yea, even such an one as never had been Known among all the people in the land from the time Lehi left Jerusalem; yea, and tens of thousands of the Lamanites were slain and scattered abroad.
3 Yea, and also there was a tremendous slaughter among the people of Nephi; nevertheless, the Lamanites were “driven and scat- tered, and the people of Nephi re- turned again to their land.
4 And now this was a time that there was a great “mourning and lamentation heard throughout all the land, among all the people of Nephi—
5 Yea, the cry of “widows mourn- ing for their husbands, and also of fathers mourning for their sons, and
the daughter for the brother, yea, | the brother for the father; and thus | the cry of mourning was heard among all of them, mourning for | their kindred who had been slain. 6 And now surely this was a
sorrowful day ; yea, a time of solem- |}
nity, and a time of much “fasting and | prayer.
7 And thus endeth the fifteenth | year of the reign of the judges over | the people of Nephi;
8 And Ammon and his brethren, their journeyings in the land of Nephi, | their sufferings in the land, their || sorrows, and their afflictions, and | their ?incomprehensible joy, andthe | reception and safety of the brethren | in the land of Jershon. And now may the Lord, the Redeemer of all men, bless their souls forever.
9 And this is the account of the wars and contentions among the Nephites, and also the wars between the Nephites and the Lamanites; *and the fifteenth year of the reign of the judges is ended.
10 And from the “first year to the | fifteenth has brought to pass the | destruction of many thousand lives; yea, it has brought to pass an awful scene of bloodshed.
11 And the bodies of many | thousands are laid low in the earth, || while the bodies of many thousands are “moldering in heaps upon the face of the earth; yea, and many thousands are "mourning for the loss of their kindred, because they have reason to fear, according to the promises of the Lord, that they are consigned to a state of endless wo.
12 While many thousands of others truly “mourn for the loss of their kindred, yet they rejoice and exult | in the hope, and even know, accord- ing to the promises of the Lord, that

5. Yea, and I know that good and evil have come before all men; he that knoweth not good from evil is *blameless; but he that ’knoweth good and evil, to him it is given according to his desires, whether he desireth good or evil, life or death, joy or remorse of ‘conscience.
6 Now, seeing that I know these things, why should I desire more than to “perform the work to which I have been called?
7 Why should I desire that I were an angel, that I could speak unto all the ends of the earth?
8 For behold, the Lord doth “grant unto "all nations, of their own nation and ‘tongue, to teach his word, yea, in wisdom, all that he ¢seeth fit that they should have; therefore we see that the Lord doth counsel in wisdom, according to that which is just and true.

for me, yea, even that he hath heard my prayer; yea, then do I remember his merciful arm which he extended towards me.
11 Yea, and I also remember the captivity of my fathers; for I surely do know that the “Lord did de- liver them out of bondage, and by this did establish his church; yea, the Lord God, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, did deliver them out of bondage.
12 Yea, Lhave always remembered the captivity of my fathers; and that same God who “delivered them out of the hands of the Egyptians did deliver them out of "bondage.
13 Yea, and that same God did establish his church among them; yea, and that same God hath called me by a “holy calling, to "preach the word unto this people, and hath given me much success, in the which my joy is full.
14 But I do not joy in my own success alone, but my joy is more full because of the success of my brethren, who have been up to the land of Nephi.
15 Behold, they have labored exceedingly, and have brought forth much fruit; and how great shall be their reward !
16 Now, when I think of the success of these my brethren my soul is carried away, even to the separation of it from the body, as it were, so great is my “joy.
17 And now may God grant unto these, my brethren, that they may sit down in the kingdom of God; yea, and also all those who are the fruit of their labors that they may go no more out, but that they may praise him forever. And may God grant that it may be done according to my words, even as I have spoken. Amen.

Korihor, the antichrist, ridicules Christ, the atonement, and the spirit | of prophecy—He teaches that there is no God, no fall of man, no penalty for sin, and no Christ—Alma testifies that Christ shall come and that all things denote there is a God—Korihor demands a sign and is struck dumb— | The devil had appeared to Korihor as | an angel and taught him what to say— He is trodden down and dies.
BEHOLD, now it came to pass that after the “people of Ammon were established in the land of Jershon, yea, and also after the Lamanites were °driven out of the land, and their dead were buried by the people | of the land—
2 Now their dead were not num- bered because of the greatness of their numbers ; neither were the dead of the Nephites numbered—but it came to pass after they had buried their dead, and also after the days of “fasting, and ’mourning, and prayer, (and it was in the sixteenth year of the reign of the judges over the peo- ple of Nephi) there began to be con- tinual peace throughout all the land.
3 Yea, and the people did observe to keep the commandments of the Lord; and they were strict in observ- ing the “ordinances of God, accord- ing to the law of Moses; for they were taught to "keep the law of Moses until it should be fulfilled.
4 And thus the people did have no disturbance in all the sixteenth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.

hemla, and he was “Anti-Christ, for he began to preach unto. the people *against the prophecies: which had been spoken by the prophets, con- cerning the coming of Christ.
7 Now there was no law against a *man’s belief ; for it was strictly con- trary to the commands of God that there should be a law which should bring men on to unequal grounds.
8 For. thus saith the scripture: “Choose ye this day, whom ye will serve.
9 Now if a man desired to serve God, it was his privilege; or rather, if he believed in God it was-his privilege to serve him; but if he did not believe in him there was no law to punish him.
10 But if he “murdered he was punished unto °death; and if he ‘robbed he was also punished; and if he stole he was also punished; and if he committed “adultery he was also punished; yea, for all this wickedness they were punished.
11 For there was a law that men should be judged according to their crimes: Nevertheless, there-was no law against a man’s belief; there- fore, a man was punished only for the crimes which he had done; there- fore all men were on “equal grounds.
12 And this *Anti-Christ, whose name was Korihor, (and the law could. have no hold- upon him) began to preach unto the people that there should be °no Christ. And after this manner did he preach, saying:

16 Ye look forward and say that ye see a remission of your sins. But behold, it is the effect of a “frenzied mind; and this derangement of your minds comes because of the tradi- tions of your fathers, which lead you away into a belief of things which are not so.
17 And many more such things did he say unto them, telling them that there could be no atonement made for the sins of men, but every man “fared in this life according to the management of the creature; there- fore every man prospered according to his genius, and that every man conquered according to hisstrength; and ’whatsoever a man did was ‘no crime.
18 And thus he did preach unto them, leading away the hearts of many, causing them to lift up their heads in their wickedness, yea, lead- ing away many women, and. also men, to commit whoredoms—telling them that when a man was dead, that was the end thereof.
19 Now this man went over to the land of ?Jershon also, to preach these things among the people of Ammon, who were once the people of the Lamanites.
20 But behold they were more wise than many of the Nephites; for they took him, and bound him, and car- tied him before Ammon, who was a “high priest over that people.

21 And it came to pass that he caused that he should be carried out of the land. And he came over into the land of Gideon, and began to preach unto them also; and here he did not have much success, for he was taken and bound and carried before the high priest, and also the chief judge over the land.
22 And it came to pass that the high priest said unto him: Why do ye go about perverting the ways of the Lord? Why do ye teach this people that there shall be no.Christ, to interrupt their rejoicings? Why do ye speak against all the prophe- cies of the holy prophets?
23 Now the high priest’s name was Giddonah. And Korihor said unto him: Because I do not teach the foolish traditions of your fathers, and because I do not teach this people to bind themselves down under the foolish ordinances and performances which are laid down by ancient priests, to usurp power and authority over them, to keep them in ignorance, that they may not lift up their heads, but be brought down according to thy words.
24 Ye say that this people is a free people. Behold, I say they are in bondage. Ye say that those ancient prophecies are true. Behold, I say that ye do not know that they are true.
25 Ye say that this people is a guilty and a fallen people, because of the transgression of a parent. Behold, I say that a child is not guilty because of its parents.
26 And ye also say that Christ shall come. But behold, I say that ye do not know that there shall be a Christ. And ye say also that he shall be slain for the “sins of the world—
27 And thus ye lead away this people after the foolish traditions of your fathers, and according to your

own desires; and ye keep them down, even as it were in bondage, that ye may glut yourselves with the labors of their hands, that they durst not look up with boldness, and that they durst not enjoy their rights and privileges.
28 Yea, they durst not make use of that which is their own lest they should offend their priests, who do yoke them according to their desires, and have brought them to believe, by their traditions and their dreams and their whims and their visions and their pretended mysteries, that they should, if they did not do according to their words, offend some unknown being, who they say is God—a being who “never has been seen or known, who "never was nor ever will be.
29 Now when the high priest and the “chief judge saw the hardness of his heart, yea, when they saw that he would °revile even against God, they would not make any reply to his words; but they caused that he should be bound; and they delivered him up into the hands of the officers, and sent him to the land of Zara- hemla, that he might be brought before Alma, and the chief judge who was governor over all the land.
30 And it came to pass that when he was brought before Alma and the chief judge, he did go on in the same manner as he did in the land of Gideon; yea, he went on to “blas- pheme.
31 And he did rise up in great “swelling words before Alma, and did revile against the °priests and teachers, accusing them of leading away the people after the silly tradi- tions of their fathers, for the sake of glutting on the labors of the people.
32 Now Alma said unto him: Thou knowest that we do not glut our- selves upon the labors of this people; for behold I have “labored even from

the commencement of the reign of the judges until now, with mine *own hands for my ;support, not- withstanding my many travels round about the land to declare the word of God unto my people.
33 And notwithstanding the many labors which I have performed in the church, I have never received sO much as even one “senine for my labor; neither has any of my breth- ren, save it were in the judgment- seat; and then we have received only according to law for our time.
34 And now, if we do not receive anything for our laborsin the church, what doth it profit-us to labor in the church save it were to declare the truth, that we may have rejoicings in the “joy of our brethren?
35 Then why sayest thou that we preach unto this people to get gain, when thou, of thyself, knowest that we receive no gain? And now, believest thou that we deceive this people, that “causes such joy in their hearts?
36 And Korihor answered him, Yea.
37 And then Alma said unto him: Believest thou that there is a God?
38 And he answered, Nay.
39 Now Alma said unto him: Will ye deny again that there is a God, and also deny the Christ? For be- hold, { say unto you, I know there is a God, and also that Christ shall come.
40 And now what evidence have ye that there is no “God, or that Christ cometh not? I say unto you that ye havenone, save it be yourword only.
41 But, behold, I have all things as a “testimony that these things are true; and ye also have all things asa testimony unto you that they are
32b Acts 20: 34 (33-35);
Alma 30: 52.
ALMA 30:33-47
true; and will ye deny them? Believest thou that these things are true?
42 Behold, I know that thou *believest, but thou art possessed with a ‘lying spirit, and ye have put ‘off the Spirit of God that it may have no place in you; but the devil has power over you, and he doth carry you about, working devices — he may destroy the children of
od.
43 And now Korihor said unto Alma: If thou wilt show me a “sign, that I may be convinced that there is'a God, yea, show unto me that he hath power, and then will I be convinced of the truth of thy words.
44 But Alma said unto him: Thou hast had signs enough; will ye tempt your God? Will ye say, Show unto me a sign, when ye have the testi- mony of “all these thy brethren, and also all the holy prophets? The scriptures are laid before thee, yea, and all things denote there is a God; yea, even the "earth, and “all things that are upon the face of it, yea, and its ¢motion, yea, and also all the ‘planets which move in their regular form do witness that there is a Supreme Creator.
45 And yet do ye go about, leading away the hearts of this people, testifying unto them there is no God? And yet will ye deny against all these *witnesses? And he said: Yea, I willdeny,except ye shall show me a sign.
46 And now it came to pass that Alma said unto him: Behold, Iam grieved because of the hardness of your heart, yea, that ye will still resist the spirit of the truth, that thy soul may be destroyed.

48 Now Korihor said unto him: I do not deny the existence of a God, but I do not believe that there is a God; and I say also, that ye do not know that there isa God; and except ye show me a sign, I will not believe.
49 Now Alma said unto him: This will I give unto thee for a sign, that thou shalt be “struck dumb, accord- ing to my words; and I say, that in the name of God, ye shall be struck dumb, that ye shall no more have utterance.
50 Now when Alma had said these words, Korihor was struck dumb, that he could not have utterance, according to the words of Alma.
51 And now when the chief judge saw this, he put forth his hand and wrote unto Korihor, saying: Art thou convinced of the power of God? In-whom did ye desire that Alma should show forth his sign? Would ye that he should afflict others, to show unto thee a sign? Behold, he has showed unto you a sign; and now will ye dispute more?
52 And Korihor put forth his hand and wrote, saying: I know that I am dumb, for I cannot speak; and I know that nothing save it were the “power of God could bring this upon me; yea, and I always ’knew that there was a God.
53 But behold, the devil hath “deceived me; for he ’appeared unto me in the ‘form of an angel, and said unto me: Go and reclaim this people, for they have all gone astray after

an unknown God. And he said unto me: There is 4no God; yea, and he taught me that which I should say. And I have taught his words; and I taught them because they were pleasing unto the °carnal mind; and I taught them, even until I had muchsuccess, insomuch that I verily believed that they were true; and for this cause I withstood the truth, even until I have brought this great fcurse upon me,
54 Now when he had said this, he besought that Alma should pray unto God,-that the “curse might be taken from him.
55 But Alma said unto him: If this curse should be taken from thee thou wouldst again lead away the hearts of this people; therefore, it shall be unto thee even as the Lord will.
56 And it came to pass that the curse was not taken off of Korihor; but he was “cast out, and went about from house to house begging for his food.
57 Now the knowledge of what had happened unto Korihor was immedi- ately published throughout all the land; yea, the proclamation was sent forth by the chief judge to all the people in the land, declaring un- to those who had believed in the words of Korihor that they must speedily repent, “lest the same judg- ments would come unto them.
58 And it came to pass that they were all convinced of the wicked- ness of Korihor; therefore they were all converted again unto the Lord; and this put an end to the iniquity after the manner of Korihor. And Korihor did go about from house to house, begging food for his support.
59 And it came to pass that as he went forth among the people, yea, among a people who had separated themselves from the Nephites and called themselves *“Zoramites, being

led by a man whose name was Zoram—and as he went forth amongst them, behold;-he was run upon and trodden down, even until he was dead.
60 And thus we see the end of him who “perverteth the ways of the Lord; and thus we see that the devil will not ’support his children at the last day, but doth speedily drag them down to ‘hell.
CHAPTER 31
Alma heads a mission to reclaim the apostate Zoramites—The Zoramites deny Christ, believe in a false concept of election, and worship with set prayers—The missionaries are filled with the Holy Spirit—Their afflictions are swallowed up in the joy of Christ.
Now it came to pass that after the end of  Korihor, Alma’ having received tidings that the Zoramites were perverting the ways of the Lord, and that Zoram, who was their leader, was leading the hearts of the people to “2bow down to dumb “idols, his heart again began ‘to~“sicken because of the iniquity of the people.
2 For it was the cause of great ‘sorrow to Alma to know of iniquity among his people; therefore his heart was exceedingly ‘sorrowful because of the separation of the Zoramites from the Nephites.
3 Now the Zoramites had gathered themselves together in a land which they called *Antionum, which was east of the land of Zarahemla, which lay nearly bordering upon the sea- shore, which was south of the land

of °Jershon, which also bordered upon the wilderness south, which wilderness was full of the Laman- ites.
4 Now the Nephites greatly feared that the Zoramites would enter into a “correspondence with the Laman- ites, and that it would be the means of great loss on the part of the Nephites.
5 And now, as the “preaching of the ’word had a great tendency to ‘lead the people to do that which was just—yea, it had had more powerful effect upon the minds of the people than the sword, or any- thing else, which had happened unto them—therefore Alma thought it was expedient that they should try the virtue of the word of God.
6 Therefore he took Ammon, and Aaron, and Omner; and Himni he did leave in the church in Zara- hemla; but the former three he took with him, and also “Amulek and Zeezrom, who were at Melek; and he also took two of his sons.
7 Now the eldest of his sons he took not with him, and his name was Helaman; but the names of those whom he took with him were *Shiblon and °Corianton; and these are the names of those who went with him among the °Zoramites, to preach unto them the word.
8 Now the Zoramites were °dis- senters from the Nephites; there- fore they had had the word of God preached unto them.
9 But they had “fallen into great errors, for they would not observe to keep the commandments of God,

and his statutes, according to the law of Moses.
10 Neither would they observe the “performances of the church, to continue in prayer and supplication to God daily, that they might not enter into temptation.
11 Yea, in fine, they did pervert the ways of the Lord in very many instances; therefore, for this cause, Alma and: his brethren went into the land to preach the word unto them. a:
12 Now, when they had come into the land, behold, to their astonish- ment they found that the Zoramites had built synagogues, and that they did gather themselves together on one day of the week, which day they did call the day of the Lord; and they did *worship after a manner which Alma and his brethren had never beheld;
13 For they had a place built up in the center of their synagogue, a place for standing, which was high above the head; and the top thereof would only admit one person.
14 Therefore, whosoever desired to *worship must: go forth and stand upon the top thereof, and stretch forth his hands towards heaven, and cry with a loud voice, saying:
15 Holy, holy God; we believe that thou art God, and we believe that thou art holy, and that thou wast a ¢spirit, and that thou art a spirit, and that thou wilt be a spirit for- ever.
16 Holy God, we believe that thou hast separated us from our brethren; and we do not believe in the tradi- tion. of our brethren, which was handed down to them by the child- ishness of their fathers; but we believe that thou hast “elected us to be thy "holy children; and also thou hast made it known unto us that ‘there shall be 4no Christ.

17 But thou art the same yester- _ day, today, and forever; and thou hast “elected us that we shall be saved, whilst all around us are elected to be cast by thy wrath down to hell; for the which holiness, _ O God, we thank thee; and we alsc thank thee that thou hast elected us, that we may not be led away after the foolish traditions of our brethren, which doth °bind them down to a belief of Christ, which doth lead their hearts to wander far from thee, our God.
18 And again we thank thee, O God, that we are a chosen and a holy people. Amen.
19 Now it came to pass that after Alma and his brethren and his sons had heard these prayers, they were astonished beyond all measure.
20 For behold, every man. did go forth and offer up these same °prayers.
21 Now the place was called: by them: Rameumptom, which, being interpreted, is the holy stand.
22 Now, from this stand they did offer up, every man, the selfsame prayer unto God, thanking their God that they were chosen of him, and that he did not lead them away after the tradition of their brethren, and that their hearts were not stolen away to believe in things to come, which they knew nothing about.
23 Now, after the people had all offered up thanks after this manner, they returned to their homes, “never speaking of their God again until they had assembled themselves together again to the holy stand, to offer up thanks after their manner.
24 Now when Alma saw this his heart was “grieved; for he saw that they were a wicked and a perverse people; yea, he saw that their hearts were set upon gold, and upon silver, and upon all manner of fine goods.

25 Yea, and he also saw that their hearts were “lifted up unto great boasting, in their pride.
26 And he lifted up his voice to heaven, and “cried, saying: O, how long, O Lord, wilt thou suffer that thy servants shall dwell here below in the flesh, to behold such gross wickedness among the children of men?
27 Behold, O God, they “cry unto thee, and yet their hearts are swallowed up in their pride. Behold, O God, they cry unto thee with their mouths, while they are puffed up, even to greatness, with the vain things of the ‘world.
28 Behold, O my God, their costly apparel, and their ringlets, and their "bracelets, and their ornaments of gold, and all their precious things which they are ornamented with; and behold, their hearts are set upon them, and yet they cry unto thee and say—We thank thee, O God, for we are a chosen people unto thee, while others shall perish.
29 Yea, and they say that thou hast made it known unto them that there shall be no Christ.
30 O Lord God, how long wilt thou suffer that such wickedness and in- fidelity shall be among this people? O Lord, wilt thou give me'strength, that I may “bear with mine infirmi- ties. For I am infirm, and such wickedness among this people doth pain my soul.

33 Wilt thou grant unto them that they may have strength, that they may “bear their: afflictions which shall come upon them because of the iniquities of this people.

35 Behold, O Lord, their ‘souls are precious, and many of them are our brethren; therefore, give unto us, O Lord, power and wisdom that we may bring these, our brethren, again unto thee.
36 Now it came to pass that when Alma had said these words, that he “clapped his "hands upon all them who were with him. And behold, as he clapped his hands upon them, they were filled with the Holy Spirit.
37 And after that they did separate themselves one from another, °tak- ing no thought for themselves what they should eat, or what they should drink, or what they should
put on.
38 And the Lord provided for them that. they ‘should hunger not, neither should they thirst; yea, and he also gave them strength, that they should suffer no manner of ®afflictions, save it were swallowed up in the joy of Christ. Now this was according to the prayer of Alma; and this because he prayed in faith.

CHAPTER 32
Alma teaches the poor whose afflictions had humbled them—Faith is a hope in that which is not seen which ts true —Alma testifies that angels minister to men, women, and children— Alma compares the word unto a seed—lIt must be planted and nourished— Then it grows into a tree from which the fruit of eternal life is picked.
AND it came to pass that they did go forth, and began to preach the word of God unto the people, enter- ing into their synagogues, and into
their houses; yea, and even they did preach the word in their streets.
2 And it came to pass that after much labor among them, they began to have success among the “poor class of people; for behold, they were cast out of the synagogues because of the coarseness of their apparel—
3 Therefore they were not permit- ted to enter into their synagogues to worship. God, being esteemed as filthiness; therefore they were poor; yea, they were esteemed by their brethren as “dross; therefore they were "poor as to things of the world; and also they were poor in heart.
4 Now; as Alma was teaching and speaking unto the people upon the hill *Onidah, there came a great ’multitude unto him, who were those of whom we have been speak- ing, of whom were ‘poor in heart, because of their poverty as to the things of the world.
5 And they came unto Alma; and the one who was the foremost among them said unto him: Behold, 4what shall these my brethren do, for they are "despised of all men because of their poverty, yea, and
more especially by our priests; for | they have ‘cast us out of our syn- | agogues which we have labored | abundantly to build with our own hands; and they have cast us out because of our exceeding poverty; and: we have 4no place to worship our God; and behold, “what shall we do?
6 And now when Alma heard this, he turned him about, his face im- mediately towards him, and he be- held with great joy; for he beheld that their ‘afflictions had truly *humbled- them, and that they were in a “preparation to hear the word.
7 Therefore he did say no more to the other multitude; but he stretched forth his hand,.and cried unto: those whom he beheld, who were truly penitent, and said unto them:
8 I behold that ye are “lowly in heart; and if so, blessed are ye.
9 Behold thy brother hath said, What shall we do ?—for we are cast out of our synagogues, that we cannot worship our God.
10 Behold I say unto you, do ye suppose that ye “cannot worship God save it be in your synagogues only?
11 And moreover, I would ask, do ye suppose that ye must not worship God orly “once in a week?
12 I say unto you, it is well that ye are cast out of your synagogues, that ye may be humble, and that ye may learn ‘wisdom; for it is meces- sary that ye should learn wisdom; for it is because that ye are cast out, that ye are despised of your brethren because of your exceeding "poverty, that ye are brought to a lowliness of heart; for ye are necessarily brought to be humble.

14 And now, as I said unto you, that because ye were compelled to be “humble ye were blessed, do ye not suppose that they are more blessed who truly humble them- selves because of the word?
15 Yea, he that truly humbleth himself, and repenteth of his sins, and endureth to the end, the same shall be blessed—yea, much more blessed than they who are com- pelled to be humble because of their exceeding poverty.
16 Therefore, blessed are they who "humble themselves without being *’compelled to be humble; or rather, in other words, blessed is he that believeth in the word of God, and is baptized without ‘stubbornness of heart, yea, without being brought to know the word, or even compelled to know, before they will believe.
17 Yea, there aremany whodosay: If thou wilt show unto us a “sign from heaven, then we shall know of a surety; then we shall believe.
18 Now | ask, is this faith? Behold, I say unto you, Nay; for if a man knoweth a thing he hath no cause to “believe, for he knoweth it.
19 And now, how much “more bcursed is he that ‘knoweth the @will of God and doeth it not, than he that only believeth, or only hath cause to believe, and falleth into ‘trans- gression?

Behold, I say unto you, that it ison the one hand even as it is on the other; and it shall be unto every man. according to his work.
21 And now as I said concerning faith—“faith is not to havea perfect knowledge of things; therefore if ye have faith ye "hope for things which are ‘not seen, which are true.
22 And now, behold, I say unto you, and I would that ye should remember, that God is “merciful unto all who believe on his name; therefore he desireth, in the first place, that ye should believe, yea, even on his word.
23 And now, he imparteth his word by angels unto men, yea, “not only men but women also. Now this is not all; little *children do have words given unto them many times, which ‘confound the wise and the learned.
24 And now, my beloved brethren, as ye have desired to know of me what ye shall do because ye are afflicted and cast out—now I do not desire that ye should suppose that I mean to judge you only according to that which is true—
25 For I do not mean that ye all of you have been compelled to humble yourselves; for I verily believe that there are some among you who “would humble themselves, let them be in whatsoever circumstances they might.
26 Now, as I said concerning faith —that it was not a perfect knowl- edge—even so it is with my words. Ye cannot know of their surety at first, unto perfection, any more than faith is a perfect knowledge.
27 But behold, if ye will awake and arouse your faculties, even to an experiment upon my words, and

exercise a particle of faith, yea, even if ye can no more than “desire to believe, let this desire work in you, even until ye believe in a manner that ye can give place for a portion of my words. t
28 Now, we will compare the word unto a “seed. Now, if ye give place, that a "seed may be planted in your ‘heart, behold, if it be a true seed, or a good seed, if ye do not cast it out by your “unbelief, that ye will resist the Spirit of the Lord, behold, it will begin to swell within your breasts; and when you feel these swelling motions, ye will begin to say within yourselves—It must needs be that this is a good seed, or that the word is good, for it beginneth to enlarge my soul; yea, it beginneth to ’en- lighten my ‘understanding, yea, it beginneth to be delicious to me.
29 Now behold, would not this in- crease your faith? I say unto you, Yea; nevertheless it hath not grown up to a perfect knowledge.
30 But behold, as the seed swelleth, and sprouteth, and beginneth to grow, then you must needs say that the seed is good; for behold it swell- eth, and sprouteth, and beginneth to grow. And now, behold, will not this strengthen your faith? Yea, it will strengthen your faith: for ye will say I know that this is a good seed; for behold it sprouteth and beginneth to grow.
31 And now, behold, are ye sure that this is a good seed? I say unto you, Yea; for every seed bringeth forth unto its own “likeness.
32 Therefore, if a seed groweth it is good, but if it groweth not, behold it is not good, therefore it is cast away.
33 And now, behold, because ye have tried the experiment, and planted the seed, and it swelleth and
290
sprouteth, and beginneth to grow, ye must needs know that the seed is good.
34 And now, behold, isyour*knowl- |
edge 'perfect? Yea, your knowledge is perfect in that thing, and your
‘faith is dormant; and this because | you know, for ye know that the |
word hath swelled your souls, and ye also know that it hath sprouted
up, that your understanding doth |
begin.to be enlightened, and your 4mind doth begin to expand.
35 O then, is not this real? I say unto you, Yea, because it is “light; and whatsoever is light, is good, because it is discernible, therefore ye must know that it is good; and now. behold, after ye have tasted this light is your knowledge perfect?
36 Behold I say unto you, Nay; neither must ye lay aside your faith, for ye have only exercised your faith to plant the seed that ye might try the experiment to know if the seed was good.
37 And behold, as the tree begin- neth to grow, ye will say: Let us nourish it with great care, that it may get root, that it may grow up, and bring forth fruit unto us. And now behold, if ye nourish it with much care it will get root, and grow up, and bring forth fruit.
38 But if ye ‘neglect the tree, and take no thought for its nourishment,
behold it will not get any root; and |
when the heat of the sun cometh and scorcheth it, because it hath no root it withers away, and ye pluck it up and cast it out.
39 Now, this is not because the seed was not good, neither is it because the fruit thereof would not be desirable; but it is because your *sround is barren, and ye will not nourish the tree, therefore ye cannot have the fruit thereof.

40 And thus, if ye will not nourish the word, looking forward with an eye of faith to the fruit-thereof, ye can never pluck of the fruit of the tree of life.
41 But if ye will nourish the word, yea, nourish the tree as it beginneth to grow, by your faith with great diligence, and with “patience, look- ing forward to the fruit thereof, it _ shall take root; and: behold it shall _ be a tree ’springing up unto ever- lasting life.
42 And because of your “diligence and your faith and your patience with the word in nourishing it, that it may take root in you, behold, by and by ye shall pluck the °fruit thereof, which is most. precious, which is sweet above all that is sweet, and which is white above all that is white, yea, and pure above all that is pure; and ye shall feast upon this fruit even until ye are filled, that ye hunger not, neither shall ye thirst.
43 Then, my brethren, ye shall “reap the "rewards of your faith, and your diligence, and patience, and long-suffering, waiting for the tree to bring forth ‘fruit unto you.
CHAPTER 33
Zenos taught that men should pray and worship in all places, and that judgments are turned away because of the Son—Zenock taught that mercy is bestowed because of the Son— Moses had lifted up in the wilderness a type of the Son of God.
| Now after Alma had spoken these ' words, they sent. forth unto him
\} desiring to know whether they
should believe in “one God, that they.

might obtain this fruit of which he had spoken, or "how they should plant the ‘seed, or the word of which he had spoken, which he said must be planted in their hearts; or in what manner they should begin to exer- cise their faith.
2 And Alma said unto them: Be- hold, ye have said that ye “could not >worship your God because ye are cast out of your synagogues. But behold, I say unto you, if ye suppose that ye cannot worship God, ye do greatly err, and ye ought to search the “scriptures; if ye suppose that they have taught you this, ye do not understand them.
3 Do ye remember to have read what “Zenos, the prophet of old, has said concerning prayer or ’worship?
4 For he said: Thou art merciful, O God, for thou hast heard my prayer, even when I was “in the wilderness; yea, thou wast merciful when I prayed concerning those who were mine "enemies, and thou didst turn them to me.
5 Yea, O God, and thou wast merci- ful unto me when I did cry unto thee in my “field; when I did cry unto thee in my prayer, and thou didst hear me.
6 And again, O God, when I did turn to my house thou didst hear me in my prayer.
7 And when I did turn unto my “closet, O Lord, and prayed unto thee, thou didst hear me.
8 Yea, thou art merciful unto thy children when they cry unto thee, to be heard of thee and not of men, and thou “wilt hear them.
9 Yea, O God; thou hast been merci- ful unto me, and heard my cries in the midst of thy congregations.

10 Yea, and thou hast also heard me when I have been “cast out and have been despised by mine ene- mies; yea, thou didst hear my cries, and wast angry with mine enemies, and thou didst visit them in thine anger with speedy destruction.
11 And thou didst hear me because of mine afflictions and my “sincerity ; and it is because of thy Son that thou hast been thus merciful unto me, therefore I will cry unto thee in all mine “afflictions, for in thee is my joy; for thou hast turned thy judg- ments away from me, ‘because of thy Son.
12 And now Alma said unto them: Do ye “believe those scriptures which have been written by them of old?
13 Behold, if ye do, ye must believe what ?Zenos said; for, behold he said: Thou hast turned away thy judgments because of thy Son.
14 Now behold, my brethren, I would ask if ye have read the scriptures? If ye have, how can ye 4disbelieve on the Son of God?
15 For it is “not written that Zenos alone spake of these things, but >Zenock also spake of these things—
16 For behold, he said: Thou art angry, O Lord, with this people, be- cause they “will not understand thy. mercies which thou hast bestowed upon them because of thy Son.
17 And now, my brethren, ye see that asecond prophet of old has testi- fied of the Son of God, and because the people would not understand his words they “stoned him to death.

are not the only ones who have | spoken concerning the Son of God. | 19 Behold, he was spoken of by 2Moses; yea, and behold a type was _ ‘raised up in the wilderness, that

20 But few understood the mean- ing of those things, and this because of the hardness of their hearts. But there were many who were so hardened that they would not look, therefore they perished. Now the reason they would not look is be- cause they did not believe that it would “heal them.
21 O my brethren, if ye could be healed by merely casting about your eyes that ye might be healed, would ye not behold quickly, or would ye rather harden your hearts in °un- belief, and be °slothful, that--ye would not cast about your eyes, that ye might perish?
22 If so, wo shall come upon you; but if not so, then cast about your eyes and “begin to believe in the Son of God, that he will come to redeem his people, and that he shall suffer and die to ’atone for their sins; and that he shall ‘rise again from the dead, which shall bring to pass the @resurrection, that all men shall stand before him, to be °judged at the last and judgment day, accord- ing to their ‘works.

CHAPTER 34
Amulek testifies that the word is in Christ unto salvation—Unless an atonement is made, all mankind must perish—The whole law of Moses points toward the sacrifice of the Son of God—The eternal plan of redemp- tion is based on faith and repentance— Pray for temporal and spiritual blessings—This life is the time for men to prepare to meet God—Work out your salvation with fear and trembling.
AND now it came to pass that after Alma had spoken these words unto them he sat down upon the ground, and *Amulek arose and began to teach them, saying:
2 My brethren, I think that it is impossible that ye should be ignor- ant of the things which have been spoken concerning the coming of Christ, who is taught by us to be the Son of God; yea, I Know that “these things were taught unto you bounti- fully before your dissension from among us.
3 And as ye have desired of my beloved brother that he should make known unto you “what ye should do, because of your afflic- tions; and he hath spoken some- what unto you to prepare your minds; yea, and he hath exhorted you unto faith and to patience—
4 Yea, even that ye would have so much faith as even to “plant the
23d Mosiah 24: 15 (13-15);
b Alma 33: 15; Hel. 8: 20

word in your hearts, that ye may
_ try the experiment of its goodness.
5. And we have beheld that the great question which is in your minds is whether the word be in the Son of God, or whether there shall be “no Christ.
6 And ye also beheld that my brother has proved unto you, in many instances, that the ¢word is in Christ unto salvation.
7 My brother has called upon the words of ?Zenos, that redemption cometh through the Son of God, and also upon the words of °Zenock; and also he has appealed unto ‘Moses, to prove that these things are true.
8 And now, behold, I will *testify unto you of myself that these things are true. Behold, I say unto you, that I do know that Christ shall come among the children of men, to take upon him the “transgressions of his people, and that he shall ‘atone for the sins of the world; for the Lord God hath spoken it.
9 For it is expedient that an “atone- ment should be made; for according to the great "plan of the Eternal God there must be an atonement made, or else all mankind must unavoid- ably perish; yea, all are hardened; yea, all are ‘fallen and are lost, and must perish except it be through the atonement which it is expedient should be made.
10 For it is expedient that there should be a great and last “sacrifice; yea, not a “sacrifice of man, neither of beast, neither of any manner of fowl; for it shall not be a human sacrifice; but it must be an ‘infinite and eternal “sacrifice.

11 Now there is not any man that can sacrifice his own blood which will atone for the sins of another. Now, if a man murdereth, behold will our law, which is “just, take the life of his brother? I say unto you, Nay.
12 But the law requireth the “life of him who hath ’murdered; there- fore there can be nothing which is short of an infinite atonement which will suffice for the sins of the world.
13 Therefore, it is expedient that there should be a great and last sacrifice, and then shall there be, or it is expedient there should be, a "stop to the shedding of "blood; then shall the ‘law of Moses be fulfilled; yea, it shall be all fulfilled, every jot and tittle, and none shall have passed away.
14 And behold, this is the whole “meaning of the “law, every whit ‘pointing to that great and last 4sacrifice; and that great and last “sacrifice will be the Son of God, yea, ‘infinite and eternal.
15 And thus he shall bring “salva- tion to all those who shall believe on his name; this being the intent of this last sacrifice, to bring about the bowels of mercy, which over- powereth justice, and _ bringeth about means unto men that they may have faith unto repentance.
16 And thus “mercy can satisfy the demands of "justice, and encircles them in the arms of safety, while he that exercises no faith unto repent- ance is exposed to the whole law of
294
the demands of ‘justice; therefore only unto him that has faith unto repentance is brought about the great and eternal “plan of ‘redemp- tion.
17 Therefore may God grant unto you, my brethren, that ye may begin to exercise your “faith unto repentance, that ye begin to "call upon his holy name, that he would have mercy upon you;
18 Yea, cry unto him for mercy; for he is “mighty to save.
19 Yea, humble yourselves, and continue in “?prayer unto him.
20 Cry unto him when ye are in your “fields, yea, over all your flocks.
21 *Cry unto him in your houses, yea, over all your household, both morning, mid-day, and evening.

24 Cry unto him over the crops of your fields, that ye may prosper in them.
25 Cry over the flocks of your fields, that they may increase.

28 And now behold, my beloved brethren, I say unto you, do not suppose that this is all; for after ye have done all these*things, if ye "turn away the needy, and the ‘naked, and visit not the sick and afflicted, and “impart of your sub- stance, if ye have, to those who stand in need—lI say unto you, if ye do not any of these things, behold, your “prayer is ‘vain, and availeth you nothing, and ye are as *hypo- crites who do deny the faith.
29 Therefore, if ye do not remem- ber to be “charitable, ye are as dross, which the refiners do cast out, (it being of no worth) and is trodden under foot of men.
30 And now, my brethren, I would that, after ye have “received so many witnesses, seeing that the holy scriptures testify of these things, ye come forth and bring >fruit unto repentance.
31. Yea, I would that ye would come forth and “harden not your hearts any longer; for behold, now is the time andthe day of your ‘salvation; and therefore, if ye will repent and “harden not your hearts, immediately shall the great plan of redemption be brought about unto you.
32 For behold, this “life is the time for men to “prepare to meet God; yea, behold the day of ‘this life is the day for men to perform their 4jabors.
33 And now, as I said unto you before, as ye have had so many
ALMA 34:28-37
*witnesses, therefore, I beseech of you that ye do not “procrastinate the day of your ‘repentance until the end; for after this day of life, which is given us to prepare for eternity, behold, if we do not im- prove our time while in this life, then cometh the @night of ‘darkness wherein there can be no labor per- formed.
34 Ye cannot say, when ye are brought to that awful “crisis, that I will repent, that I will return to my God. Nay, ye cannot say this; for that same spirit which doth possess your bodies at the time that ye go out of this life, that same spirit will have power to possess your body in that eternal world.
35 For behold, if ye have pro- crastinated the day of your repent- ance even until death, behold, ye have become “subjected to the spirit of the devil, and he doth °seal you his; therefore, the Spirit of the Lord hath withdrawn from you, and hath no place in you, and the devil hath all power over you; and this is the final state of the wicked.
36 And this I know, because the Lord hath said he dwelleth not. in “unholy temples, but in the "hearts of the ‘righteous doth he dwell; yea, and’ he has also said that the righteous shall sit down in his king- dom, to go no more out; but their garments should be made white through the “blood of the Lamb.

words, they withdrew themselves from the multitude and came over into the land of ?Jershon.
2 Yea, and the rest of the brethren, after they had preached the word unto the *Zoramites, also came Over into the land of Jershon.
3 And it came to pass that after the more popular part of the Zoramites had consulted together concerning the words which had been preached unto them, they were angry because of the word, for it did destroy their %craft; therefore they would not hearken unto the words.
4 And they sent and gathered to- gether throughout all the land all the people, and consulted with them concerning the words which had been spoken.
5 Now their rulers and their priests and their teachers did not let the people know concerning their de- sires; therefore they found out privily the minds of all the people.
6 And it came to pass that after they had found out the minds of all the people, those who were in favor of the words which had been spoken by Alma and his brethren were cast out of the land; and they were “many; and they came over also into the land of Jershon.
7 And it came to pass that Alma and his brethren did minister unto them.
8 Now the “people of the Zoramites were angry with the people of Ammon who were in Jershon, and the °chief ruler of the Zoramites, being a very wicked man, sent over unto the people of Ammon desiring them that they should cast out of their land all those who came over from them into their land.
9 And he breathed out many
these things, and that ye should *work out your salvation with fear before God, and that ye should no more deny the coming of Christ;
38 That ye “*contend no more against the Holy Ghost, but that ye receive it, and take upon you the *’name of Christ; that ye humble yourselves even to the dust, and ‘worship God, in whatsoever place ye may be in, in spirit and in truth; and that ye live in “thanksgiving daily, for the many “mercies and blessings which he doth bestow upon you.
39 Yea, and I also “exhort you, my brethren, that ye be ’watchful unto prayer continually, that ye may not be led away by the ‘temptations of the devil, that he may not over- power you, that ye may not become his subjects at the last day; for behold, he rewardeth you ¢no good thing.
40 And now my beloved brethren, I would exhort you to have “pa- tience, and that ye bear with all manner of afflictions; that ye do not ‘revile against those who do cast you out because of your 2exceeding poverty, lest ye become sinners like unto them;
41 But that ye have “patience, and bear with those afflictions, with a firm hope that ye shall one day rest from all your afflictions.

threatenings against them. And now the people of Ammon did not fear their words; therefore they did not cast them out, but they did receive all the poor of the Zoramites that came over unto them; and they did “nourish them, and did ‘clothe them, and did give unto them lands for their inheritance; and they did administer unto them according to their wants.
10 Now this did *stir up the Zora- mites to ‘anger against the people of Ammon, and they began to mix with the Lamanites and to stir them up also to anger against them.
11 And thus the Zoramites and the Lamanites began to make prepara- tions for war against the people of Ammon, and also against the Ne- phites.
12And thus ended the *seven- teenth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.
13 And the people of Ammon de- parted out of the land of Jershon, and came over into the land of Melek, and gave place in the land of Jershon for the armies of» the Nephites, that they might contend with the armies of the Lamanites and the armies of the Zoramites; and thus commenced a war betwixt the Lamanites and the Nephites, in the eighteenth year of the reign of the judges; and an “account shall be given of their wars hereafter.
14 And Alma, and Ammon, and their brethren, and also the “two sons of Alma returned to the land of Zarahemla, after having been in- struments in the hands of God of bringing *many of the “Zoramites to repentance; and as many as were brought to repentance were driven out of their land; but they have lands for their inheritance in the land of Jershon, and they have

taken up arms to defend themselves, and their wives, and children, and their lands,
15 Now Alma, being “grieved for the iniquity of his people, yea for the wars, and the bloodsheds, and the contentions which were among them; and having been to declare the word, or sent to declare the word, among all the people in every city; and seeing that the hearts of the people began to wax hard, and that they began to be °offended because of the strictness of the word, his heart was exceedingly sorrowful.
16 Therefore, he caused that his sons should be gathered together, that he might give unto them every one his “charge; separately, con- cerning the things pertaining unto righteousness. And we have an account of his commandments, which he gave unto them according to his own record.
The commandments of Alma to his son Helaman. Comprising chapters 36 and 37.
CHAPTER 36
Alma testifies to Helaman of his con- version by an angel—He suffered the pains of a damned soul; he called upon the name of Jesus, and was then born of God—Sweet joy filled his soul—He saw concourses of angels praising God—His_ converts have tasted and seen as he did.
My ¢son, give ear to my words; for I swear unto you, that inasmuch as ye shall keep the commandments of God ye shall prosper in the land.

>deliver them except it was the ‘God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob; and he surely did deliver them in their afflictions.
3 And now, O my son Helaman, behold, thou art in thy youth, and therefore, I beseech of thee that thou wilt hear my words and learn of me; for I do know that whosoever shall put their *trust in God shall be supported in their trials, and their troubles, and their afflictions, and shall be ‘lifted up at the last day.
4 And I would not that ye think that I *know of myself—not of the temporal but of the spiritual, not of the °carnal mind but of God.
5 Now, behold, I say unto you, if I had not been “born of God I should *not have known these things; but God has, by the mouth of his holy ‘angel, made these things known unto me, not of any ¢worthiness of myself;
6 For I went about with the sons of Mosiah, seeking to “destroy the church of God; but behold, God sent his holy angel to stop us by the
way.
7 And behold, he spake unto us, as it were the voice of thunder, and the whole earth did “tremble beneath our feet; and we all fell to the earth, for the "fear of the Lord came upon
us.
8 But behold, the voice said unto me: Arise. And I arose and stood up, and beheld the angel.
9 And he said unto me: If thou wilt of thyself be destroyed, seek no more to destroy the church of God.

10 And it came to pass that I fell to the earth; and it was for the space of “three days and three nights that I could not open my mouth, neither had I the use of my limbs.
11 And the angel spake more things unto me, which were heard by my brethren, but I did “not hear them; for when I heard the words—If thou wilt be destroyed of thyself, seek no more to destroy the church of God— I was struck with such great fear and amazement lest perhaps I should be destroyed, that I fell to the earth and I did hear no more.
12 But I was racked with “eternal >torment, for my soul was ‘harrowed up to the greatest degree and racked with all my sins.
13 Yea, I did remember all my sins and iniquities, for which Iwas “tormented with the pains of hell; yea, I saw that I had ‘rebelled against my God, and that I had not kept his holy commandments.
14 Yea, and [had “murdered many of his children, or rather led them away unto destruction; yea, and in fine so great had been my iniquities, that the very thought of coming into the presence of my God did rack my soul with inexpressible horror.
15 Oh, thought I, that I *could be banished and become extinct both soul and body, that I might not be brought to stand in the presence of my God, to be judged of my °deeds.
16 And now, for three days and for three nights was I racked, even with the “pains of a damned soul.

18 Now, as my mind caught hold upon this thought; I cried within my heart: O Jesus, thou Son of God, “have mercy on me, who am in the ‘gall.of bitterness, and am encircled about by the. everlasting 4chains of “death.

30 But behold, my son, this is not all; for ye ought to know as I do know, that “inasmuch as ye shall keep the commandments of God ye shall "prosper in the land; and ye ought to know also, that inasmuch as ye will not keep the command- ments of God ye shall be cut off from his presence. Now this is according to his word.
CHAPTER 37
The plates of brass and other scrip- tures are preserved to bring souls to salvation—The Jaredites were de- stroyed because of their wickedness— Their secret oaths and covenants must be kept from the people—Counsel with the Lord in all thy doings—As the Liahona guided the Nephites, so the word of Christ leads men. to eternal life.
AND now, my son Helaman, I com- mand you that ye take the “records whichhave been entrusted with me;
2 And I also command you that ye keep a “record of this people, accord- ing as I have done, upon the plates of Nephi, and keep all these things
300
sacred which I have kept, even as I have kept them; for it is for a "wise purpose that they are kept.
3 And these “plates of brass, which contain these engravings, which have the records of the holy scrip- tures upon them, which have the *’senealogy of our forefathers, even from the beginning—
4 Behold, it has been prophesied by our fathers, that they should be kept and “handed down from one genera- tion to another, and be kept and preserved by the hand of the Lord until they should go forth unto every nation, kindred, tongue, and people, that they shall know of the ’mysteries contained thereon.
5 And now behold, if they are kept they must retain their brightness; yea, and they will retain their bright- ness; yea, and also shall all the plates which do contain that which is holy writ.
6 Now ye may suppose that this is “foolishness in me; but behold I say unto you, that by ’small and simple things are great things brought to pass; and small means in many instances doth confound the wise.
7 And the Lord God doth work by ‘means to bring about his great and eternal purposes; and by very *’small means the Lord doth ‘con- found the wise and bringeth about the salvation of many souls.
8 And now, it has hitherto been wisdom in God that these things should be preserved; for behold, “they have "enlarged the memory of this people, yea, and convinced many of the error of their ways, and brought them to the ‘knowledge of

their God unto the salvation of their souls.
9 Yea, I say unto you,.2were it not for these things that these records do contain, which are on these plates, Ammon and_-his brethren could not have "convinced so many thousands of the Lamanites of the incorrect tradition Of their fathers; yea, these records and their ‘words brought them unto repentance; that is, they brought them to the knowledge of the Lord their God, and to rejoice in Jesus Christ their Redeemer.
10 And who knoweth but what they will be the “means of bringing many thousands of them, yea, and also many thousands of our °stiff- necked brethren, the Nephites, who are now hardening their hearts in sin and iniquities, to the knowledge of their Redeemer?
11 Now these mysteries are not yet fully made known unto me; there- fore I shall forbear.
12 And it may suffice if I only say they are preserved for a “wise pur- pose, which purpose is known unto God; for he doth counsel in wisdom over all his works, and his paths are straight, and his course is ‘one eternal round.
13 O remember, remember, my son Helaman, how ‘strict are the commandments of God. And he said: °If ye will keep my command- ments ye shall ‘prosper in the land— but if ye keep not his command- ments ye shall be cut off from his presence.
14 And now remember, my son, that God has “entrusted you with these things, which are "sacred, which he has kept sacred, and also which he will keep and ‘preserve for

a 4wise purpose in him, that he may show forth his power unto future generations.
15 And now behold, I tell you by the spirit of prophecy, that if ye transgress the commandments of God, behold, these things which are sacred shall be taken away from you by the power of God, and ye shall be delivered up unto Satan, that he may sift you as chaff before the wind.
16 But if ye keep the command- ments of God, and do with these things which are sacred according to that which the Lord doth com- mand you, (for you must appeal unto the Lord for all things whatso- ever ye must do with them) behold, no power of earth or hell can “take them from you, for God is powerful to the fulfilling of all his words.
17 For he will fulfil all his *prom- ises which he shall make unto you, for he has fulfilled his promises which he has made unto our fathers.
18 For he promised unto them that he would “preserve these things for a wise purpose in him, that he might show forth his power unto future generations.
19 And now behold, one purpose hath he fulfilled, even to the restora- tion of “many thousands of the Lamanites to the knowledge of the truth; and he hath shown forth his power in them, and he will also still show forth his power in them unto ‘future generations; therefore they shall be preserved.
20 Therefore I command you, my son Helaman, that ye be diligent in fulfilling all my words, and that ye be diligent in keeping the command- ments of God as they are written. 21 And now, I will speak unto

you. concerning those “twenty-four plates, that ye keep them, that the ’mysteries and the works of dark- ness, and their secret works, or the secret works of those people who have been destroyed, may be made ‘manifest unto this people; yea, all their murders, and robbings, and their. plunderings, and all their wickedness and abominations, may be made manifest unto this people; yea, and that ye preserve these 4interpreters.
22 For behold, the Lord saw that his people began to work in dark- ness, yea, work secret murders and abominations; therefore the Lord said, if they did not repent they should be destroyed from off the face of the earth.
23 And the Lord said: I will pre- pare unto my servant Gazelem; a *stone, which shall shine forth in darkness unto light, that I may *discover unto my people who serve me, that I may discover unto them the works of their brethren, yea, their secret works, their works of darkness, and their wickedness and abominations.
24 And now, my son, these “inter- preters were prepared that the word of God might be fulfilled, which he spake, saying:
25 I will *bring forth out of dark- ness unto light all their secret works and their abominations; and except they repent I will destroy them from off the face of the earth; and I will bring to light all their secretsand abominations, unto every nation that shall hereafter possess the land.
26 And now, my son, we see that they did not repent; therefore they have been destroyed, and thus far the word of God has been fulfilled;
302
yea, their ‘secret abominations have been brought out of darkness and made known unto us.
27 And now, my son, I command you that ye retain all their oaths, and their covenants, and their agreements in their secret abomi- nations; yea, and all their “signs and their wonders ye shall "keep from this people, that they know them not, lest peradventure they should fall into darkness also and be destroyed.
28 For behold, there is a “curse upon all this land, that destruction shall come upon all those workers of darkness, according to the power of God, when they are fully ripe; therefore I desire that this people might not be destroyed.
29. Therefore ye shall keep these secret plans of their 7oaths and their covenants from this people, and only their wickedness. and_ their murders and their abominations shall ye make known unto them; and ye shall teach them to °abhor such wickedness and abominations and murders; and ye shall also teach them that these people were destroyed on. account .of their wickedness and abominations. and their murders.
30 For behold, they @murdered all the prophets of the Lord who came among them to declare unto them concerning their iniquities; and the blood of those whom they murdered did cry unto the Lord their God for vengeance upon those who were their murderers; and thus the judgments of God did come upon these workers of darkness and secret ’combinations.

darkness and secret combinations, even unto destruction, except they repent before they are-fully "ripe.
32 And now, my son, remember the words which I have spoken unto you; trust not those secret plans unto this people, but teach them an everlasting “hatred against sin and iniquity. 4
33 *Preach unto them repentance, and faith on the Lord Jesus Christ; teach them to humble themselves and to be ’meek and lowly in heart; teach them to ‘withstand. every 4temptation of the devil, with their faith on the Lord Jesus Christ.
34 Teach them to never be weary of good works, but to be meek and lowly in heart; for such shall find "rest to their souls.

37 *Counsel with the Lord in all thy doings, and he will direct thee for >’so0od; yea, when thou liest down at night lie down unto the Lord, that he may watch over you in your sleep; and when thou risest in the ‘morning let thy heart be full of thanks unto God; and if ye do these things, ye shall be lifted up at the last day.

38 And now, my son, I have some- what to say concerning the thing which our fathers call a ball, or director—or our fathers called it *Liahona, which is, being inter- preted, a compass; and the Lord prepared it.
39 And behold, there cannot any man work after the manner of so curious a workmanship. And behold, it was prepared to show unto our fathers the course which they should travel in the wilderness.
40 And it did work for them according to their “faith in God; therefore, if they had faith to be- lieve that God could cause that those spindles should point the way they should go; behold, it was done; therefore they had this miracle, and also many other miracles wrought by the power of God, day by day.
41. Nevertheless,» because those miracles were worked by» “small means it did.show unto them mar- velous works. They were ’slothful, and forgot to exercise their faith and diligence and then those mar- velous works ceased, and they did not progress in their journey ;
42 Therefore, they tarried in the wilderness, or did “not travel a direct course, and were afflicted with hunger and thirst, because of their transgressions.
43 And now, my son, I would that ye should understand that these things are not without a “shadow; for as our fathers were slothful to give heed to this compass (now these things were temporal) they

did not prosper; even so it is with things which are spiritual.
44 For behold, it is as easy to give heed to the *word of Christ, which will point to you a straight course to eternal bliss, as it was for our fathers to give heed to this compass, which would point unto them a straight course to the promised land.
45 And now I say, is there not a *type in this thing? For just as surely as this director did bring our fathers, by following its course, to the promised land, shall the words of Christ, if we follow their course, carry us beyond this vale of sorrow into a far better land of promise.
46 O my son, do not let us be ¢sloth- ful because of the "easiness of the ‘way ; for so was it with our fathers ; for so was it prepared for them, that if they would “look they might ‘live; even so it is with us. The way is pre- pared, and if we will look we may live forever.
47 And now, my son, see that ye take care of these sacred things, yea, see that ye "look to God and live. Go unto this people and declare the word, and besober. My son, farewell.

My “son, give ear to my words, for | I say unto you, even as I said unto | Helaman, that “inasmuch as ye_ | shall keep the commandments of God ye shall prosper in the land; || and ‘inasmuch as ye will not keep |
the commandments of God ye shall |}
be4cut off from his “presence. 2 And now, my son, I trust that I | shall have great joy in you, be- ||
cause of your “steadiness and your |
faithfulness unto God; for as you | have commenced in your youth | to look to the Lord your God, even so I hope that you will continue in keeping: his commandments; for piesa is he that °endureth to the end.
3 I say unto you, my son, that I have had great joy in thee already, because of thy faithfulness and_thy diligence, and thy patience and thy long-suffering among the people of the*Zoramites.
4 For I know that thou wast in bonds; yea, and I also know that thou wast stoned for the word’s sake; and thou didst bear all these things with “patience because the Lord was °with thee; and now thou knowest that the Lord did deliver thee.
5 And now my son, Shiblon, I would that ye should remember, that as much as ye shall put your “trust in God even so much ye shall be °delivered out of your trials, and your ‘troubles, and your afflictions, and ye shall be lifted up at the last day.

should think that I know these things of myself, but it is the Spirit of God which is in meWhich maketh these things known unto me; for if I had not been “born of God I should not have known these things. ;
7 But behold, the Lord in his great mercy sent his “angel to declare unto me that I must stop the work of *destruction among his people; yea, and I have seen an angel face to face, and he spake with me, and his voice was as thunder, and it shook the whole earth.
8 And it came to pass that I was *three days and three nights in the most bitter "pain and ‘anguish of soul; and never, until I did cry out unto the Lord Jesus Christ for mercy, did I receive a “remission of my sins. But behold, I did cry unto him and I did find peace to my soul.
9 And now, my son, I have told you this that ye may learn wisdom, that ye may learn of me that there is “no other way or means whereby man can be saved, only in and through Christ. Behold, he is the life and the “light of the world. Behold, he is the word of truth and ‘righteousness.
10 And now, as ye have begun to teach the word even so I would that ye should continue to teach; and I would that ye would be diligent and “temperate in all things.
11 See that ye are not lifted up unto pride; yea, see that ye do not “boast in your own wisdom, nor of your much strength.
12 Use “boldness, but not over- bearance; and. also see that ye ‘bridle all your passions, that ye may be filled with love; see that ye refrain from idleness.

13 Do not “pray as the Zoramites do, for ye have seen that they pray to be heard of men, and to be praised for their wisdom.
14 Do not say: O God, I thank thee that we are “better than our breth- ren; but rather say: O Lord, forgive my °unworthiness, and remember my brethren in mercy—yea, ac- knowledge your unworthiness be- fore God at. all times.
15 And may the Lord bless your soul, and receive you at the last day into his kingdom, to sit down in peace. Now go, my son, and teach the word unto this people. Be “sober. My son, farewell.

3 And this is not all, my son. Thou didst do that which was grievous unto me; for thou didst forsake the ministry, and did go over into the land of Siron among the borders of the Lamanites, after the “harlot Isabel.
4 Yea, she did “steal away the hearts of many; but this was no ex- cuse for thee, my son. Thou shouldst have tended to the ministry where- with thou wast entrusted.
5 Know ye not, my son, that these things are an abomination in the sight of the Lord; yea, most “abom- inable above all sins save it be the shedding of innocent "blood or denying the Holy Ghost?
6 For behold, if ye “deny the Holy Ghost when it once has had place in you, and ye know that ye deny it, behold, this is a sin which is °un- pardonable; yea, and whosoever murdereth against the light and knowledge of God, it is not easy for him to obtain ‘forgiveness; yea, I say unto you, my son, that it is not easy for him to obtain a forgive- ness.
7 And now, my'son, I would to God that ye had not been “guilty of so great a crime. I would not dwell upon your crimes, to harrow up your soul, if it were not for your good.
8 But behold, ye cannot “hide your crimes from God; and except ye repent they will stand as a testi- mony against you at the last day.

should repent and forsake your sins, and go no more after the “lusts of your eyes, but °cross yourself in all these things; for except ye do this ye can in nowise inherit the king- dom of God. Oh, remember, and take it upon you, and “cross yourself in these things.

11 Suffer not yourself to be led away by any vain or foolish thing; suffer not the devil to lead away your heart again after those wicked harlots. Behold, O my son; how great “iniquity ye brought upon the >Zoramites; for when they saw your ‘conduct they would not believe in my words.
12 And now the Spirit of the Lord doth say unto me: *Command thy children to do good, lest they "lead away the hearts of many people to destruction; therefore I command you, my son, in the fear of God, that ye ‘refrain from your iniquities;
13 That ye turn to the Lord with all your mind, might, and strength; that ye lead away the hearts of no more to do wickedly; but rather return unto them, and °acknowl- edge your faults and that wrong which ye have done.

15 And now, my son, I would say somewhat unto you concerning the *coming of Christ. “Behold, I say unto you, that it is he that surely shall come to take away the sins of the world; yea, he cometh to declare glad tidings of salvation unto his people. P
16 And now, my son, this was the ministry unto which ye were called, to declare these glad tidings unto this people, to prepare their minds; or rather that salvation might come unto them, that they may prepare the minds of their *children to hear the word at the time of his coming.
17 And now I will ease your mind somewhat on this subject. Behold, you marvel why these things should be Known so long beforehand. Be- hold, I say unto you, is not a soul at this time as precious unto’God as a soul will be at the time of his coming?
18 Is it not as necessary that the plan of redemption should be “made known unto this people as well as unto their children?
19 Is it not as easy at this time for the Lord to “send his angel to declare these glad tidings unto us as unto our children, or as after the time of his coming?

Christ bringeth to pass the resurrection of all men—The righteous dead go to paradise and the wicked to outer dark- ness to await the day of their resur- rection—All things shall be restored to their proper and perfect frame in the resurrection.

concerning the resurrection of the dead.
2 Behold, I say unto you, that there is no resurrection— or, I-would say, in other words, that this mortal does not put on “immortality, this corruption does not» ’put on in- corruption—until after the coming of Christ.
3 Behold, he bringeth to pass the “resurrection of the dead. But be- hold, my son, the resurrection is not yet. Now, I unfold unto you a mystery; nevertheless, there are many ’mysteries which are ‘kept, that no one kKnoweth them save God himself. But I show unto you one thing which I have inquired diligently of God that I might know —that is concerning the  resur- rection.
4 Behold, there is a time appointed that all shall *come forth from the dead. Now when this time cometh no one knows; but God knoweth the time whichis appointed.
5 Now, whether there shall be one time, or a “second time, or a third time, that men shall come forth from the dead, it mattereth not; for God ’knoweth all these things; and it sufficeth me to know that this is the case—that there is a time appointed that all shall rise from the dead.
6 Now there must needs be a space betwixt the time of death and the time of the resurrection.
7 And now I would inquire what becometh of the “souls of men °from this time of death to the time ap- pointed for the resurrection?
8 Now whether there is more than one “time appointed for men to rise it mattereth not; for all do not die at once, and this mattereth not; all is

as one day with God, and time only is measured unto men.
9 Therefore, there is a time ap- pointed unto men that they shall rise from the dead; and there is a space between the time of death and the resurrection. And now, con- cerning this space of time, what becometh of the souls of men is the thing which I have inquired dili- gently of the Lord to know; and this is the thing of which I do know.
10 And when the time cometh when all shall rise, then shall they know that God “knoweth all the *times which are appointed unto man.
11 Now, concerning the “state of the soul between °death and the resurrection—Behold, it has been made known unto me by an angel, that the spirits of all men, as soon as they are departed from this mortal body, yea, the spirits of all men, whether they be good or evil, are ‘taken “home to that God who gave them life.
12 And then shall it come to pass, that the spirits of those who are righteous are received into a state of “happiness, which is> called *paradise, a state of rest, a state of ‘peace, where they shall rest from all their troubles and from all care, and sorrow.
13 And then shall it come to pass, that the “spirits of the wicked, yea, who are evil— for behold, they have no part nor portion of the Spirit of the Lord; for behold, they chose evil works rather than good; there-

fore the spirit of the ’devil did enter into them, and take possession of their house—and these shall be cast out into outer ‘darkness; there shall be 4weeping, and wailing, and gnashing of teeth, and this because of their own iniquity, being led captive by the will of the devil.
14 Now this is the state of the “souls of the wicked, yea, in dark- ness, and a state of awful, ‘fearful looking for the fiery “indignation of the wrath of God upon them; thus they remain in this “state, as well as the righteous in paradise, until the time of their resurrection.
15 Now, there are some that have understood that this state of happi- ness and this state of misery of the soul, before the resurrection, was a first resurrection. Yea, I admit it may be termed a resurrection, the *raising of the spirit or the soul and their consignation to happiness or misery, according to the words which have been spoken.
16 And behold, again it hath been spoken, that there is a “first "resur- rection, a resurrection of all those who have been, or who are, or who shall be, down to the resurrection of Christ from the dead.
17 Now, we do not suppose that this first resurrection, which is spoken of in this manner, can be the resurrection of the souls and their “consignation to happiness or mis- ery. Ye cannot suppose that this is what it meaneth.

soul with the body, of those from the days of Adam down to the resurrection of Christ:
19 Now, whether the souls and the bodies of those of whom has been spoken shall all be reunited at once, the wicked as well as the righteous, I do not say; let it suffice, that 1 say that they all come forth; or in other words, their resurrection cometh to pass “before the resurrection of those who die after the resurrection of Christ.
20 Now, my son, I do not say that their resurrection cometh at the resurrection of Christ; but behold, I give it as my opinion, that the souls and the bodies are reunited, of the righteous, at the resurrection of Christ, and his. ?ascension. into heaven.
21 But whether it be at his resur- rection or after, I do not say; but this much I say, that there is a %space between death and _ the resurrection of the body, and a state of the soul in "happiness or in ‘misery until the time which is appointed of God that the dead shall come forth, and be reunited, both soul and body, and be “brought to stand before God, and be judged according to their works.
22. Yea, this bringeth about the restoration of those things of which has been spoken by the mouths of the prophets.
23 The “soul shall be “restored to the ‘body, and the body to the soul; yea, and every limb and joint shall be restored to its body; yea, even.a 4hair of the head shall not be lost; but all things shall be restored to their proper and “perfect frame.

24 And now, my son, this is the Testoration of which has _ been "spoken by the mouths of the prophets—
25 And then shall the “righteous shine forth in the kingdom of God.
26 But behold, an awful “death cometh upon the wicked; for they die as to things pertaining to things of righteousness; for they are un- clean, and °no unclean thing can inherit the kingdom of God; but they are cast out, and consigned to partake of the fruits of their labors or their works, which have been evil; and they drink the dregs of a bitter
‘cup. CHAPTER 41
In the resurrection men come forth to a state of endless happiness or endless misery—W ickedness never was happi- ness—Carnal men are without God in the world—Every person receives again in the restoration the character- istics and attributes acquired in mortality.
AND now, my son, I have some- what to say concerning the restora- tion of which has been spoken; for behold, some have ‘wrested the scriptures, and have gone far *astray because of this thing. And I perceive that thy mind has been ‘worried also concerning this thing. But behold, I will explain it unto thee.
2 I say unto thee, my son, that the plan of restoration is requisite with the justice of God; for it is requisite that all things should be restored to their. proper order. Behold, it: is requisite and just, according to the power and resurrection of Christ,

that the soul of man should be restor- ed toits body, and that every “part of the body shouldbe restored to itself.
3 And it is requisite with the 2justice of God that men should be >judged according to their ‘works; and if their works were good in this life, and the desires of their hearts were good, that they should also, at the last day, be ¢restored unto that which is good.
4 And if their works are evil they shall be “restored unto them for evil. Therefore, all things shall be °re- stored to their proper order, every thing to its natural frame—mor- tality raised to 4immortality, °cor- ruption to incorruption—raised to fendless happiness to %inherit. the kingdom of God, or to endless misery to inherit the kingdom of the devil, the one on one hand, the other on the other—
5 The one raised to “happiness according to his desires of happiness, or good according to his desires of good; and the other toevil according to his desires of evil; for as he has desired to do evil all the day long even so shall he have his reward of evil when the night cometh.
6 And so it is on the other hand. If he hath repented of his sins, and desired righteousness until the end of his days, even so he shall bé rewarded unto righteousness.
7°These are they that are redeemed of the Lord; yea, these are they that are taken out, that are delivered from that endless night of darkness;
and thus they stand or fall; for
behold, they are their own "judges, f
whether to do good or do evil.
8 Now, the decrees of God are %nalterable; therefore, the way is prepared that “whosoever will may ‘walk therein and be saved.
9 And now behold, my son, do not |} risk “one more offense against your jj
God upon those points of doctrine,
which ye have hitherto risked to 1
commit sin.
10 Do not suppose, because it has been spoken concerning restoration, that ye shall be restored from sin to happiness. Behold, I say unto you, *wickedness never was "happiness.
11 And now, my son, all men that |
are ina state of ‘nature, or I would say, in a “carnal state, are in the ‘gall of bitterness and in the “bonds of iniquity; they are “without God in the world, and they have gone fecontrary to the nature of God; therefore, they are in a_ state contrary to the nature of happiness.
12 And now behold, is the meaning of the word restoration to take a thing of a natural state and place it in an unnatural state, or to place it ina state opposite toits nature?
13 O, my son, this is not the case; but the meaning of the word restoration is to bring back again
“evil for evil, or carnal for carnal, or |
devilish for devilish—good for that which is good; righteous for that which is righteous; just for that
whichis just ; merciful for that which
is merciful.

14 Therefore, my son, see that you are merciful unto your brethren; deal “justly, "judge righteously, and do ‘good continually ; and if ye do all these things then shall ye receive your “reward; yea, ye shall have ‘mercy restored unto you again; ye shall have justice restored unto you again; ye shall have a righteous judgment restored unto you again; and ye shall have good rewarded unto you again.
15 For that which ye do “send out shall return unto you again, and be restored; therefore, the word res- toration more fully condemneth the sinner, and justifieth him not at all.
CHAPTER 42
Mortality is a probationary time to enable man to repent and serve God— The fall brought temporal. and spiritual death upon all mankind— Redemption comes through repent- ance—God himself atoneth for the sins of the world—Mercy is for those who repent—All others are subject to God’s justice—Mercy cometh because of the atonement—Only the truly penitent are saved.
AND now, my son, I perceive there is somewhat more which doth worry your mind, which ye cannot under- stand—which is concerning the “justice of God in the punishment of the sinner ; for yedo try to suppose that it is ‘injustice that. the sinner should be consigned to a state of misery.
2 Now behold, my son, I will ex- plain this. thing unto thee. For behold, after the Lord God sent our
ALMA 41:14—42:8
first parents forth from the garden of “Eden, to till the "ground, from whence they were taken—yea, he’ drew out the man, and he placed at the east end of the garden of Eden, ‘cherubim, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the tree of life—
3 Now, we see that the man had become.as God, knowing good and evil; and lest he should put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat and live forever, the Lord God placed “cherubim and the flaming sword, that he should not partake of the fruit—
4 And thus we see, that there was a *time granted unto man to repent, yea, a ’probationary time, a time to repent and serve God.
5 For behold, if Adam had put forth his hand immediately, and ¢partaken of the °tree of life, he would have lived forever, according to the word of God, having no space for repentance; yea, and also the word of God would have been void, and the great plan of salvation would have been frustrated:
6 But behold, it was appointed unto man to “die—therefore, as they were cut off from the tree of life they should be cut off from the face of the earth—and man became ‘lost forever, yea, they became *fallen man.
7 And now, ye see by this that our first parents were “cut off both temporally and spiritually from the >presence of the Lord; and thus we see they became subjects to follow after their own ‘will.
8 Now behold, it was not expedient

that man should be reclaimed from this °temporal death, for that would destroy the great plan of happiness.
9 Therefore, as the soul could never die, and the “fall had brought upon all mankind a spiritual "death as well as a temporal, that is, they were cut off from the presence of the Lord, it was expedient that mankind should be reclaimed from this spiritual death.
10 Therefore, as they had become “carnal; sensual, and devilish, by ‘nature, this ‘probationary state became a state for them to prepare; it became a preparatory state.
11 And now remember, my son, if it were not for the plan of redemp- tion, (laying it aside) as soon as they were dead their souls were “miser- able, being cut off from the presence of the Lord.
12 And now, there was no means to reclaim men from this fallen state, which “man had brought upon him- self because of his own °disobedience;
13 Therefore, according to justice, the “plan of ’redemption could not be brought about, only on conditions of repentance of men in this pro- bationary state, yea, this prepara- tory state; for except it were for these conditions, mercy could not take effect except it should destroy the work of justice. Now the work of justice could not be destroyed; if so, God would “cease to be God.
14 And thus we see that all man- kind were “fallen, and they were in the grasp of justice; yea, the

justice of God, which consigned them forever to be cut off from his presence.
15 And now, the plan of mercy could not be brought about except an atonement should be made; therefore God himself “‘atoneth for the sins of the world, to bring about the plan of 'mercy, to appease the demands of ‘justice, that God might be a “perfect, just God, and a ‘merciful God also.
16 Now, repentance could not come unto men except there were a “punishment, which also was ‘eternal as the life of the soul should be, affixed ‘opposite to the plan of happiness, which was as “eternal also as the life of the soul.
17 Now, how could a man repent except he should “sin? How could he sin if there was no "law? How could there be a law save there was a punishment?
18 Now, there was a punishment affixed, and a just law given, which brought remorse of “conscience unto man.
19 Now, if there was no law given— if aman “murdered he should °die— would he be afraid he would die if he should murder?
20 And also, if there was no law given against sin men would not be afraid to sin.
21 And if there was “no law given, if men sinned what could justice do, or mercy either, for they would have no claim upon the creature?
22 But there is a law given, and a

“punishment affixed, and a ’repent-
ance granted; which TFepentance, mercy claimeth; othefwise, justice claimeth the creature and exe- cuteth the ‘law, and the law in- flicteth the punishment; if not so, the works of justice would be de- stroyed, and God would cease to be God.
23 But God ceaseth not to be God, and “mercy claimeth the penitent, and mercy cometh because of the ’atonement; and the atonement bringeth to pass the ‘resurrection of the dead; and the resurrection of the dead bringeth °back men into the presence of God; and thus they are restored into his presence, to be ‘judged according to their works, according to the law and justice.
24 For behold, justice exerciseth all his demands, and also “mercy claimeth all which is her own; and thus, none but the truly penitent are saved.
25 What, do ye suppose that *mercy can rob *justice? I say unto you, Nay; not one whit. If so, God would cease to be God.
26 And thus God bringeth about his. great and eternal “purposes, which were prepared from the foundation of the world. And thus cometh about.the salvation and the redemption of men, and also their destruction and misery.

28 If he has desired to do “evil, and has not repented: in his days, be- hold, evil shall be done unto him; according to the restoration of God.
29 And now, my son, I desire that ye should let these things ¢trouble you no more, and only let your sins trouble you, with that trouble which shall bring you down unto repentance.
300 my son, I desire that ye should deny the “justice of God: no more. Do not endeavor to excuse yourself in the least point because of your sins, by denying the justice of God; but do you let the justice of God, and his ’mercy, and his long-suffer- ing have full sway in your heart; and let it bring you down to the dustin ‘humility.
31 And now, O my son, ye are called of God to “preach the word unto this people. And now, my son, go thy way, declare the word with truth and -soberness, that thou mayest bring souls unto repent- ance, that the great plan of mercy may have claim upon them, And may God grant. unto you even according to my words. Amen.

reveals to Alma the strategy of the Lamanites—The Nephites defend their homes, liberties, families, and religion—The armies of Moroni and Lehi'surround the Lamanites.
AND now it came to pass that the sons of Alma did go forth among the people, to declare the word unto them. And Alma, also, himself, could not “rest, and he also went forth.
2 Now ¢we shall say no more con- cerning their preaching, except that they preached the word, and the truth, according to the spirit of prophecy and revelation; and they preached after the "holy order of God by which they were called.
3 And now “I return to an "account of the wars between the Nephites and the Lamanites, in the *eight- eenth year of the reign of the judges.
4 For behold, it came to pass that the *Zoramites became Lamanites; therefore, in the commencement of the eighteenth year the people of the Nephites saw that the Lamanites were coming upon them; therefore they made preparations for war; yea, they gathered together their armies in the land of Jershon.
5 And it came to pass that the Lamanites came with their thou- sands; and they came into the land of 7Antionum, which is the land of the Zoramites; and a man by the name of °Zerahemnah was their leader.
6 And now, as the ?Amalekites were of a more wicked and mur- derous disposition than the Laman- ites were, in and of themselves, therefore, Zerahemnah appointed chief °captains over the Lamanites,

and they were all Amalekites and ¢Zoramites.
7 Now this he did that he might preserve their “hatred towards the Nephites, that he might bring them into subjection to the accomplish- ment of his designs. :
8 For behold, his “designs were to ’stir up the Lamanites to anger against the Nephites; this he did that he might usurp great power over them, and also that he might gain power over the Nephites by bringing them into ‘bondage.
9 And now the design of the Nephites was to support their lands, and their houses, and their “wives, and their children, that they might preserve them from the hands of their enemies; and also that they might preserve their ’rights and their privileges, yea, and also their ‘liberty, that they might worship God according to their desires.
10 For they knew that if they should fall into the hands of the Lamanites, that whosoever should *worship God in ’spirit and in truth, the true and the living God, the Lamanites would ‘destroy.
11 Yea, and they also knew the extreme hatred of the Lamanites towards their “brethren, who were the people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi, who were called the people of Ammon—- and they would not take up arms, yea, they had entered into a cove- nant and they would not break it— therefore, if they should fall into the hands of the Lamanites they would be destroyed.
12 And the Nephites would not suffer that they should be de- stroyed; therefore they gave them lands for their inheritance.

13 And the people of Ammon did give unto the Nephites.a large por- tion of their substance to 4support their armies; and thus the Nephites were compelled, alone, to with- stand against the Lamanites, who were a compound of Laman and Lemuel, and the sons of Ishmael, and. all those who had dissented from the Nephites, who were Amalekites and Zoramites, and the >descendants of the priests of Noah.
14 Now those descendants were as numerous, nearly, as were the Nephites; and thus the Nephites were obliged to. contend with their brethren, even unto bloodshed.
15 And it came to pass as the armies of the Lamanites had gathered together in the “land of Antionum, behold, the armies of the Nephites were prepared, to meet them in the land of Jershon.
16 Now, the leader of the Nephites, or the man who had been “appointed to be the °chief captain over the Nephites—now the chief captain took the command of all the armies of the Nephites—and his name was Moroni;
17 And. Moroni took all the com- mand, and the government of their wars, And he was only twenty and five years old when he was appoint- ed chief captain over the armies of the Nephites.
18 And it came to pass that he met the Lamanites. in the borders of Jershon, and his people were armed with swords, and with .cimeters, and all manner of “weapons of war.
19 And when. the armies of: the Lamanites saw that the people of Nephi, or that. Moroni, had “pre- pared his people with ’breastplates and with arm-shields, yea, and also shields to defend their heads, and

also they were dressed with: thick clothing—
20 Now the army of Zerahemnah was not prepared with any such thing; they had only their ?swords and their cimeters, their bows and their arrows, their "stones and their slings; and they were ‘naked, save it were a skin which was girded about their loins; yea, all were naked, save it were the Zoramites and the Amalekites ;
21 But they were not armed with breastplates, nor shields—therefore, they were exceedingly afraid of the armies of the Nephites because of their armor, notwithstanding their number being so much greater than the Nephites.
22 Behold, now it came to pass that they durst: not come against the Nephites' in. the borders of Jershon; therefore they departed out of the land of Antionum into the wilderness, and took their journey round about in the wilderness, away by the head of the river Sidon, that they might come into the land of *Manti and take possession of the land; for they did not suppose that the armies of Moroni would know whither-they had gone.
23 But it came to pass, as soon as they had departed into the wilder- ness Moroni sent spies into the wilderness to watch their camp; and Moroni, also, knowing of the proph- ecies of Alma, sent certain men unto him, desiring him that he should “inquire of the Lord °whither the armies of the Nephites should go to defend themselves against the La- manites.
24 And it came to pass that the *word of the Lord came unto Alma, and. Alma informed the messengers of Moroni, that the armies of the

[About 74 B.c.]

Lamanites were marching round about in the wilderness, that they might come over into the land of Manti, that they might commence an attack upon the weaker part of the people. And those messengers went and delivered the message unto Moroni.
25 Now Moroni, leaving a part of his army in the land of Jershon, lest by any means a part of the Laman- ites should come into that land and take possession of the city, took the remaining part of his army and marched over into the land of Manti.
26 And he caused that all the people in that quarter of the land should gather themselves together to battle against the Lamanites, to defend their lands and their country, their rights and their liberties; therefore they were prepared against the time of the coming of the Lamanites.
27 Andit came to pass that Moroni caused that his army should be secreted in the valley which was near the bank of the river Sidon, which was on the west of the river Sidon in the wilderness.
28 And Moroni placed spies round about, that he might know when the camp of the Lamanites should come.
29 And now, as Moroni knew the ‘intention of the Lamanites, that it was their intention to destroy their brethren, or to ’subject them and bring them into bondage that they might establish a kingdom unto themselves over all the land ;
30 And he also knowing that it was the “only desire of the Nephites to preserve their lands, and _ their ‘liberty, and their church, therefore he thought it no sin that he should defend them by ‘stratagem; there- fore, he found by his spies which course the Lamanites were to take:

31 Therefore, he divided his army and brought a part over into the valley, and “concealed them on the east, and on the south of the hill Riplah;
32 And the remainder he con- cealed in the west “valley, on the west of the river Sidon, and so down into the borders of the land Manti.
33 And thus having placed his army according to his desire, he was prepared to meet them.
34 And it came to pass that the Lamanites came up on the north of the hill, where a part of the army of Moroni was concealed.
35 And as the Lamanites had passed the hill Riplah, and came into the valley, and began to cross the river Sidon, the army which was concealed on the south of the hill, which was led by a man whose name was “Lehi, and he led his army forth and encircled the Lamanites about on the east in their rear.
36 And it came to pass that the Lamanites, when they saw the Nephites coming upon them in their rear, turned them about and began to contend with the army of Lehi.
37 And the work of death com- menced on both sides, but it was more dreadful on the part of the Lamanites, for their ®nakedness was exposed to the heavy blows of the Nephites with their swords and their cimeters, which brought death almost at every stroke.
38 While on the other hand, there was now and then a man fell among the Nephites, by their swords and the loss of blood, they being shielded from the more vital parts of the body, or the more vital parts of the body being shielded from the strokes of the Lamanites, by their “breast- plates, and their armshields, and their head-plates; and thus the Nephites did carry on the work of death among the Lamanites.

39 And it came to pass that the Lamanites became frightened, be- cause of the great destruction among them, even until they began to flee towards the river Sidon.
40 And they were pursued by Lehi and his men; and they were driven by Lehi into the waters of Sidon, and they crossed the waters of Sidon. And Lehi retained his armies upon the bank of the river Sidon that they should not cross.
41 And it came to pass that Moroni and his army met the Lamanites in the “valley, on the other side of the tiver Sidon, and began to fall upon them and to slay them.
42 And the Lamanites did flee again before them, towards the land of Manti; and they were met again by the armies of Moroni.
43 Now in this case the Lamanites did fight exceedingly; yea, never had the Lamanites been known to fight with such exceedingly great strength and courage, no, not even from the beginning.
44 And they were inspired by the *Zoramites and the Amalekites, who were their chief captains and leaders, and by Zerahemnah, who was their chief captain, or their chief leader and commander; yea, they did fight like dragons, and many of the Nephites were slain by their hands, yea, for they did smite in two many of their head-plates, and they did pierce many of their breast- plates, and they did smite off many of their arms; and thus the Laman- ites did smite in their fierce anger.

‘liberties, their wives and_ their children, and their all, yea, for their rites of worship and their church.
46 And they were doing that which they felt was the ?duty which they owed to their God; for the Lord had said unto them, and also unto their fathers, that: °Inasmuch as ye are not guilty of the ‘first offense, neither the second, ye shall not suffer yourselves to be slain by the hands of your enemies.
47 And again, the Lord has said that: Ye shall “defend your families even unto °bloodshed. Therefore for this cause were the Nephites con- tending with the Lamanites, to defend themselves, and their fam- ilies, and their lands, their country, and their rights, and their religion.
48 And it came to pass that when the men of Moroni saw the fierceness and the anger of the Lamanites, they were about to shrink and flee from them. And Moroni, perceiving their intent, sent forth and inspired their hearts with these thoughts— yea, the thoughts of their lands, their liberty, yea, their freedom from bondage.
49 And it came to pass that they turned upon the Lamanites, and they “cried with one voice ’unto the Lord their God, for their ‘liberty and their freedom from bondage.
50 And they “began to stand against the Lamanites with power; and in that selfsame hour that they cried unto the Lord for their free- dom, the Lamanites began to flee before them; and they fled even to the waters of Sidon.
51 Now, the Lamanites were more “numerous, yea, by more than double the number of the Nephites ; nevertheless, they were driven inso-

much that they were gathered together in one body in the valley, upon the bank by the river Sidon.
52 Therefore the armies of Moroni encircled them about, yea, even on both sides of the river, for behold, on the east were the men of Lehi.
53 Therefore when Zerahemnah saw the men of Lehi on the east of the river Sidon, and the armies of Moroni on the west of the river Sidon, that they were encircled about by the Nephites, they were struck with terror.
54 Now Moroni, when he saw their “terror, commanded his men that they should stop shedding their
blood. CHAPTER 44
Moroni commands the Lamanites to make a covenant of peace or be de- stroyed—Zerahemnah rejects the offer, and the battle resumes—Moroni’s armies defeat the Lamanites.
AND it came to pass that they did stop and withdrew a pace from them. And Moroni said unto *Zera- hemnah: Behold, Zerahemnah, that we do ’not desire to be men of blood. Ye know that ye are in our hands, yet we do not desire to slay you.
2 Behold, we have not come out to battle against you that we might shed your blood for power; neither do we desire to bring any one to the “yoke of bondage. But this is the ’very cause for which ye have come against us; yea, and ye are angry with us because of our religion.
3 But now, ye behold that the Lord is with us; and ye behold that he has delivered you into our hands. And now I would that ye should under- stand that this is done unto us “because of our religion and our faith in Christ. And now ye see that ye cannot destroy this our faith.

4 Now ye see that this is the true faith of God; yea, ye see that God will support, and keep, and pre- serve us, so long as we are “faithful unto him, and unto our faith; and our religion; and never will the Lord suffer that we shall be de- stroyed except we should fall into transgression and deny our faith.
5 And now, Zerahemnah, I com- mand you, in the name of that all- powerful God, who has strengthened our arms that we have gained power over you, “by our faith, by our religion, and by our ?rites of wor- ship, and by our church, and by the sacred support which we owe to our ‘wives and our children, by that 4iberty which binds us to our lands and our country; yea, and also by the maintenance of the sacred word of God, to which we owe all our happiness; and by all that is most dear unto us—
6 Yea, and this is not all; I com- mand you by all the desires which ye have for life, that ye “deliver up your weapons of war unto us, and we will seek not your blood, but we will spare your lives, if ye will go your way and come not again to war against us.
7 And now, if ye do not this, be- hold, ye are in our hands, and I will command my men that they shall fall upon you, and ‘inflict the wounds of death in your bodies, that ye may become extinct; and then we will see who shall have power over this people; yea, we will see who shall be brought into bondage.
8 And now it came to pass that when Zerahemnah had heard these sayings he came forth and delivered up his “sword and his cimeter, and his bow into the hands of Moroni, and said unto him: Behold, here are

our weapons of war; we will deliver them up unto you, but we will not suffer ourselves to take an °oath unto you, which we know that we shall break, and also our children; but take our weapons of war, and suffer that we may. depart into the wilderness; otherwise we will retain our swords, and we will perish or conquer.
9 Behold, we are “not of your faith; we do not believe that it is God that has delivered us into your hands; but we believe that it is your cun- ning that has preserved you from our.swords. Behold, it is your >breastplates and your shields that have preserved you.
10.And now when Zerahemnah had made an end of speaking these words, Moroni returned the sword and the weapons of war, which he had. received, unto. Zerahemnah, saying: Behold;- we will end the conflict.
11. Now I cannot recall.the words which I have spoken, therefore as the Lord liveth, ye shall:not depart except ye depart with an oath that ye will not return again against us to war. Now as ye are in our hands we will spill. your blood upon the ground, or ye shall submit» to the conditions which I have: pro- posed.
12 And now when Moroni had said these words, Zerahemnah retained his sword, and he was angry with Moroni, and he rushed forward that he might. slay Moroni; but as he raised. his sword, behold, one of Moroni’s soldiers smote it even to the earth, and it broke by the hilt; and he also smote Zerahemnah that he took off his scalp and it fell to the earth. And Zerahemnah. with- drew. from. before them into the midst of his soldiers.
13. And it came to pass that the soldier who stood by, who smote off the scalp of Zerahemnah, took up the scalp from off the ground by the
hair, and laid it upon the point of his sword, and stretched it forth unto them, saying unto them witha loud voice:
14 Even as this scalp has fallen to the earth, which is the scalp of your chief, so shall ye fall to the earth except’ ye will deliver up your weapons of war and depart with a covenant of peace.
15 Now there’ were many, when they heard these words and saw the scalp which was upon the sword, that were struck with fear; and many came forth and threw down their weapons of war at the feet of Moroni, and entered into a “cove- nant of peace. And as many as entered into a covenant they suffered to "depart into the wilder- ness.
16> Now it came to pass that Zerahemnah was exceedingly wroth, and he did stir up the remainder of his soldiers to anger, to contend more powerfully © against the Nephites.
17 And now Moroni was angry, because of the stubbornness of the Lamanites; therefore he com- manded his people that they should fall upon them and slay them. And it came to pass that they began to slay them; yea; and the Lamanites did contend with their swords and their might.
18 But behold, their naked skins and their bare heads were exposed to the sharp swords of the Nephites; yea, behold they were pierced and smitten, yea, and did fall exceed- ingly fast before the swords of the Nephites; and they began to be swept down, even as the soldier of Moroni had prophesied.
19 Now Zerahemnah, when he saw that they were all about to be destroyed, cried mightily unto Moroni, promising that he would covenant and also his people with them, if they would spare the remainder of their lives, that they

*never would come to war again against them.
20 And it came to pass that Moroni caused that the work of: death should “cease again among the people. And he took the weapons of war from the Lamanites; and after they had entered into a °covenant with him of peace they were suffered to depart into the wilderness.
21 Now the number of their dead was not numbered because of the greatness of the number; yea, the number of their dead was exceed- ingly great, both on the Nephites and on the Lamanites.
22 And it came to pass that they did cast their dead into the waters of Sidon, and they have gone forth and are buried in the depths of the “sea.
23 And the armies of the Nephites, or of Moroni, returned and came to their houses and their lands.
24 And thus *ended the eighteenth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi. And thus ended the record of Alma, which was writ- ten upon the plates of Nephi.
The account of the people of Nephi, and their wars and dissensions, in the days of Helaman, according to the record of Helaman, which he kept in his days. Comprising chapters 45 to 62 inclusive.
CHAPTER 45
Helaman believes the words of Alma—Alma prophesies the destruc- tion of the Nephites—He blesses and curses the land—Alma is taken up by the Spirit, even as Moses—Dissension grows inthe Church.
BEHOLD, now it came to pass that the people of Nephi were exceed- ingly rejoiced, because the Lord had

again “delivered them out of the hands of their enemies; therefore they gave thanks unto the Lord their God; yea, and they did °fast much and pray much, and they did worship God with exceedingly great
joy.
2 And it came to pass in the nine- teenth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi, that Alma came unto his son Helaman and said unto him: Believest thou the words which I spake unto thee con- cerning those “records which have been kept?
3 And Helaman said unto him: Yea, I “believe.
4 And Alma said again: Believest thou in Jesus Christ, who shall come? :
5 And he said: Yea, I believe all the words which thou hast spoken.
6 And Alma said unto him again: Will ye *keep my commandments?
7 And he.said: Yea, I will keep thy commandments with all my heart.
8 Then Alma said unto him: Blessed art thou; and the Lord shall “prosper thee in this land.
9 But behold, I have somewhat to *prophesy unto thee; but what I prophesy unto thee ye shall not make known; yea, what I prophesy unto thee shall not be made known, even until the prophecy is fulfilled; therefore write the words which I shall say.
10 And these are the words: Be- hold, I perceive that this very people, the Nephites, according to the spirit of revelation which is in me, in “four hundred years from the time that Jesus Christ shall mani- fest himself unto them, shall dwindle in unbelief.
11 Yea, and then shall they see wars and pestilences, yea, famines and bloodshed,. even until the

12 Yea, and: this because they shall dwindle in unbelief and fall into the works of darkness, and *lasciviousness, and all manner of iniquities; yea, Isay unto you, that because they shall sin against so great light and knowledge, yea, I say unto you, that from that day, even the "fourth generation shall not all pass away before this great iniquity shall come.
13. And when that great day cometh, behold, the time very soon cometh that those who are now, or the seed of those who are now numbered among the people of Nephi, shall 7no more be numbered among the people of Nephi.
14 But whosoever remaineth, and is not destroyed in that great and dreadful day, shall be “numbered among the ’Lamanites, and shall become like unto them, all, save it be a few who shall be called the disciples of the Lord; and them shall the Lamanites pursue even ‘until they shall become extinct. And now, because of iniquity, this prophecy shall be fulfilled.
15 And now it came to pass that after Alma had said these things to Helaman, he “blessed him, and also his other sons; and he also blessed the earth for the "righteous’ sake.
16 And he said: Thus saith the Lord .God—*Cursed shall be the land, yea, this land, unto every nation, kindred, tongue, and people, unto destruction, which do ’wicked- ly, when they are fully ripe; and as I have said so shall it be; for this is the cursing and the “blessing of God upon the land, for the Lord cannot
ALMA 45:12-22
look upon sin with the “least degree of allowance,
17.And now, when Alma had said these words he blessed the “church, yea, all those who should stand fast in the faith from that time ‘hence- forth.
18 And when Alma had done this he “departed out of the land of Zarahemla, as if to go into the land of "Melek. And it came to pass that he was never heard of more; as to his death or burial we know not of.
19 Behold, this we know, that he was a righteous man; and the saying went abroad in the church that he was taken up by the “Spirit, or *buried by the hand of the Lord, even as Moses. But behold, the scriptures saith the Lord took Moses unto himself; and we sup- pose that he has also received Alma in the spirit, unto himself; there- fore, for this cause we know nothing concerning his death and burial.
20 And now it came to pass in the *commencement of the nineteenth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi, that Helaman went. forth among the people to declare the “word unto them.
21 For behold, because of their wars with the Lamanites and the many little dissensions and dis- turbances which had been among the people, it became expedient that the “word of God should be declared among them, yea, and that a b’regulation should be made through- out the church.
22 Therefore, *Helaman and _ his brethren went forth to establish the church again in all the land, yea, in every city throughout all the land which was possessed by the people

of Nephi. And it came to pass that they did appoint “priests and ‘teachers throughout all ‘the land, over all the churches.
23 And now it came to pass that after Helaman and his brethren had appointed priests and teachers over the churches that there arose a “dissension among them, and they would not give heed to the words of Helaman and his brethren ;
24 But they grew proud, being lift- ed up in their hearts, because of their exceedingly great “riches; therefore they grew rich in their own eyes, and would not give heed to their words, to walk uprightly before
God. CHAPTER 46
Amalickiah conspires to be king— Moroni raises the title of liberty—He rallies the people to defend their religion—True_ believers are called Christians—A remnant of Joseph shall be preserved—Amalickiah and the dissenters flee to the land of Nephi —Those who will not support the cause of freedom are put to death.
AND it came to pass that as many as would not hearken to the “words of Helaman and his brethren were gathered together against their brethren.
2 And now behold, they were exceedingly wroth, insomuch that they were determined to slay them.
3 Now the leader of those who were wroth against their brethren was a large and a strong man; and his name was “Amalickiah.
4 And Amalickiah was desirous to be a “king; and those people who were wroth were also desirous that he should be their king; and they

were the greater part of them the lower ’judges of the land, and they were seeking for power.
5 And they had been led by the “flatteries of Amalickiah, that if they would support him and establish him to be their king that he would make them rulers over the people.
6 Thus they were led away by Amalickiah to dissensions, not- withstanding the preaching of Hela- man and his brethren, yea, notwith- standing their exceedingly great care over the church, for they were *hiyh priests over the church.
7 And there were many in the church who believed in the “flatter- ing words of Amalickiah, therefore they °dissented even from the church; and thus were the affairs of the people of Nephi exceedingly precarious and dangerous, not- withstanding their great ‘victory which they had had over the Lamanites, and their great rejoic- ings which they had had because of their “deliverance by the hand of the Lord.
8 Thus we see how “quick the children of men do forget the Lord their God, yea, how quick to do ‘iniquity, and to be led away by the evil one.
9 Yea, and we also see the great *wickedness one very wicked man can cause to take place among the children of men.
10 Yea, we see that Amalickiah, because he was a man of cunning device and a man of many flatter- ing words, that he led away the hearts of many people to do wick- edly; yea, and to seek to “destroy the church of God, and to destroy the foundation of *liberty which

God had granted unto them, or which blessing God had sent upon the face of the land for the ‘right- eous’ sake.
11 And -now it came to pass that when Moroni, who was the “chief commander of the armies of the Nephites, had heard of these dis- sensions; he was angry with Amalickiah.
12 And it came to pass that he rent his coat; and he took:a piece thereof, and wrote upon it—‘*In memory of our God, our religion, and freedom, and our peace, our wives, and our children—and. he fastened it upon the end of a pole.
13 And he fastened on his head- plate, and his “breastplate, and his shields, and girded on his armor about his loins; and he took the pole, which had on the end thereof his rent coat, (and he called it the *title of liberty) and he “bowed him- self to the earth,-and he prayed mightily unto his God for the bless- ings of liberty to rest upon his brethren, so long as there should a band of ‘Christians remain to possess the land—
14 For thus were all the true believers of Christ, who belonged to the church of God, called by those who did not belong to the church.
15 And those who did belong to the church were “faithful; yea, all those who were true believers in Christ *took upon them, gladly, the name of Christ, or ‘Christians as they were called, because of their belief in Christ who should come.
16-And therefore, at this time, Moroni prayed that the cause of the

Christians, and the “freedom of the land might be favored.
17 And it came to pass that when he had poured out his soul to:God, he named all the land which was “south of the land ’Desolation, yea, and in fine, all the land, both on the ‘north and on the south—A chosen land, and the land of “liberty.
18 And he said: Surely God shall not “suffer that we, who are despised because we take upon us the name of Christ, shall be trodden down and destroyed, until we bring it upon us by our own °transgressions.
19 And when Moroni had said these words, he went forth among the people, waving the “rent part of his garment in the air, that all might see the writing which he had written upon the rent part, and crying with aloud voice, saying:
20 Behold, whosoever will main- tain: this, title upon the land, let them come forth in the strength of the Lord, and “enter into a covenant that they will "maintain their rights, and their religion, that the Lord God may bless them.
21 And it came to pass that when Moroni had proclaimed these words, behold; the people came running “together with their armor girded about their loins, °rending’ their garments in token, or as a “covenant, that they would not forsake the Lord their God; or, in other words, if they should transgress the com- mandments of God, or fall into transgression, and be ¢ashamed to take upon them the name of Christ, the Lord should rend them even as they had rent their garments.

22 Now this was the covenant which they made, and they “cast their garments at the feet of Moroni, saying: We covenant with our God, that we shall be destroyed, even as our brethren in the land northward, if we shall fall into transgression; yea, he may cast us at the feet of our enemies, even as we have cast our garments at thy feet to be trodden under foot, if we shall fall into transgression.
23 Moroni said unto them: Behold, we are a “remnant of the seed of Jacob; yea, we are a remnant of the seed of ° Joseph, whose ‘coat was rent by his brethren into many pieces; yea, and now behold, let us remem- ber to keep the commandments of God, or our garments shall be rent by our brethren, and we be cast into prison, or be sold, or be slain.
24 Yea, let us preserve our liberty as a “remnant of Joseph; yea, let us remember the words of Jacob, before his death, for behold, he saw that a °part of the ‘remnant of the coat of Joseph was ¢preserved and had not decayed. And he said— Even as this remnant of garment of my son hath been preserved, so shall a remnant of the seed of my son be preserved by the hand of God, and be taken unto himself, while the remainder of the seed of Joseph shall perish, even as the remnant of his garment.
25 Now behold, this giveth my soul sorrow; nevertheless, my soul hath joy in my son, because of that part of his seed which shall be taken unto God.
26 Now behold, language of Jacob.

us? Yea, and even it shall be our- selves if we do not stand fast in the faith of Christ.
28 And now it came to pass that when Moroni had said these words he went forth, and also sent forth in all the parts of the land where there were dissensions, and gathered to- gether all the people who were desirous to maintain their liberty, to stand against Amalickiah and those who had dissented, who were called Amalickiahites.
29 And it came to pass that when Amalickiah saw that the people of Moroni were more numerous than the Amalickiahites—and he also saw that his people were “doubtful concerning the justice of the cause in which they had undertaken— therefore, fearing that he should not gain the point, he took those of his people who would and departed into the "land of Nephi.
30 Now Moroni thought it was not expedient that the Lamanites should have any more “strength; therefore he thought to cut off the people of Amalickiah, or to take them and bring them back, and put Amalickiah to death; yea, for he knew that he would stir up the Lamanites to anger against them, and cause them to come to battle against them; and this he knew that Amalickiah would do that he might obtain his purposes.
31 Therefore Moroni thought it was expedient that he should take his armies, who had gathered them- selves together, and armed them- selves, and entered into a covenant to keep the peace—and it came to pass that he took his army and marched out with his tents into the wilderness, to cut off the course of Amalickiah in the wilderness.

33 And it came to pass that Amialickiah ?fled with a small num- ber of his men, and the remainder were delivered up into the hands of Moroni and were taken back into the land of Zarahemla.
34 Now, Moroni being a man who was “appointed by the chief judges and the voice of the people, there- fore he had power according to his will with the armies of the Nephites, to establish and to exercise author- ity over them,
35 And it came to pass that whom- soever of the Amalickiahites that would not enter into a covenant to support the “cause of freedom, that they might maintain-a free "govern- ment, he caused to be put to death; and there were but few who denied the covenant of freedom.
36 And it came-to pass also, that he caused the “title of liberty to be hoisted. upon every tower. which was in all the land, which was pos- sessed by the Nephites; and thus Moroni planted the standard of liberty among the Nephites.
37 And they began to have peace again in the land; and thus they did maintain peace in the land until nearly the *end of the nineteenth year of the reign of the judges.
38 And Helaman and the “high priests did also maintain order in the church; yea, even for the space of four years did they have much peace and rejoicing in the church.
39 And it came to pass that there were many who died, firmly “believ- ing that their souls were redeemed by the Lord Jesus Christ; thus they went out of the world rejoicing:
40 And there were some who died

with fevers, which at some seasons of the year were. very frequent in the land—but not so much'so with fevers, because of the excellent qualities of the many “plants and roots which God had prepared to remove the cause of °diseases, to which men were subject by the nature of the climate—
41 But there were many who died with “old age; and those who died in the faith of Christ are "happy in him, as we must needs suppose.
CHAPTER 47
Amalickiah uses treachery, murder, and intrigue to become king of the Lamanites—The Nephite dissenters are more wicked and ferocious than the Lamanites.
Now we will return in our record to Amialickiah and those who had “fled with him into the wilderness; for, behold, he had taken. those who went with him, and went up in the ‘land of Nephi among the Laman- ites, and did ‘stir up the Lamanites to anger against the people of Nephi, insomuch that the king of the Lamanites sent a proclamation throughout all his land, among all his people, that they should gather themselves together again to go to battle against the Nephites.
2 And it came to pass that when the proclamation had gone forth among them they were exceedingly afraid; yea, they “feared: to dis- please the king; and they also feared to go to battle against the Nephites lest they should lose their lives. And it came to pass that they would not, or the more part of them would not, obey the commandments of the king.
3 And now it came to pass that the

king was wroth’ because of their disobedience; therefore he gave Amalickiah the command of that part of his army which was obedient unto his» commands, and com- manded him that he should go forth and “compel them to arms.
4 Now behold, this was the desire of Amalickiah; for he being a very "subtle man to do evil therefore he laid the plan in his heart to °de- throne the king of the Lamanites.
5 And now he had got the com- mand of those parts of the Laman- ites who were in favor of the king; and he sought to gain favor of those who were not obedient; therefore he went forward to the place which was called “Onidah, for thither had all the Lamanites fled; for they dis- covered the army coming, and, supposing that they were coming to destroy them, therefore they fled to Onidah, to the place of arms.
6 And they had appointed a man to be a king and a leader over them, being fixed in their minds with a determined resolution that they would “not be subjected to go against the Nephites.
7 And it came to pass that they had gathered themselves together upon the top of the mount which was called Antipas, in preparation to battle.
8 Now it was not Amalickiah’s in- tention to give them battle accord- ing to the commandments of the king; but behold, it was his inten- tion to gain favor with the armies of the Lamanites, that he might place himself at their head and dethrone the king and take possession of the kingdom.
9 And behold, it came to pass that he caused his army to pitch their tents in the valley which was near the mount Antipas.
10 And it came to pass that when it was night he sent a secret em- bassy into the mount Antipas, desiring that the leader of those who

were upon the mount, whose name was Lehonti, that he should come down to the foot of the mount, for he desired to speak with him.
11 And it came to pass that when Lehonti received the message he durst not go down to the foot of the mount. And it came to pass that Amalickiah sent again the second time, desiring him to come down. And it came to pass that Lehonti would not; and he sent again the third time.
12 And it came to pass that when Amialickiah found that he could not get Lehonti to come down off from the mount, he went up into the mount, nearly to Lehonti’s camp; and he sent again the fourth time his message unto Lehonti, desiring that he would come down, and that he would bring his guards with him.
13 And it came to pass that when Lehonti had come down with his guards to Amalickiah, that Ama- lickiah desired him to come down with his army in the night-time, and surround those men in their camps over whom the king had given him command, and that he would deliver them up into Lehonti’s hands, if he would make him (Amalickiah) a second “leader over the whole army.
14 Andit came to pass that Lehonti came down with his men and sur- rounded the men of Amalickiah, so that before they awoke at the dawn of day they were surrounded by the armies of Lehonti.
15 And it came to pass that when they saw that they were surrounded, they plead with Amalickiah that he would suffer them to fall in with their brethren, that they might not be destroyed. Now this was the very thing which Amalickiah desired.
16 And it came to pass that he delivered his men, “contrary to the commands of the king. Now this was the thing that Amalickiah
16a Alma 47: 3.
[72 Bic.
327
desired, that he might~accomplish his designs in dethroning the king,
17 Now it was the custom among the Lamanites, if their chief leader was killed, to appoint the second leader to be their chief leader.
18 And it camé to pass that Amalickiah caused that one of his servants should administer “?poison by degrees to Lehonti, that he died.
19 Now, when Lehonti was dead, the Lamanites: appointed Ama- lickiah to be their leader and their chief commander.
20 And it came to pass. that Amalickiah marched with his armies (for he had gained his desires) to the land of Nephi, to the city of Nephi, which was the chief city.
21 And the king came out to meet him. .with his guards, for he sup- posed that Amalickiah had ?ful- filled his commands, and that Amalickiah had gathered together so great an.army to go against the Nephites to battle.
22 But behold,.as the king came out to meet him Amalickiah caused that his servants should go forth to meet the king. And they went and “bowed themselves before the king, as if to reverence him because of his greatness.
23. And it came to pass that the king put forth his hand to raise them, as was the custom with the Lamanites, as a token of peace, which custom they had taken from the Nephites.
24 And it came to pass that when he had raised the. first from the ground, behold he stabbed the king to the heart; and he fell to the earth.
25 Now the servants of the king
fled; and the servants of Amalickiah raised a cry, saying: 26. Behold, the servants of the king have stabbed him to the heart, and he has fallen and they have fled; behold, come and see.
27 And-»it came to pass. that

ALMA 47:17-34
Amalickiah commanded that. his armies should march forth and see what had happened to the king; and when they had come to the spot, and found the king lying in his gore, Amalickiah pretended to be wroth, and said: Whosoever loved the king, let him go forth, and pursue his servants that they may be slain.
28 And it came to pass that all they who loved the king, when they heard these words, came forth and pursued after the servants of the king.
29 Now when the ‘servants of the king saw an army pursuing after them, they were frightened again, and fled into the wilderness, and came over into the land of Zara- hemla and joined the "people of Ammon.
30.And the army which pursued after them returned, having pur- sued after them in vain; and thus Amalickiah, by his “fraud, gained the hearts of the people.
31 And it came to pass on the morrow he entered the city Nephi with his armies, and took possession of the city.
32 And now it came to pass that the queen, when she had heard that the king was slain—for Amalickiah had sent an embassy to the queen in- forming her that the king had been slain by his servants, that he had pursued them with his army, but it was in vain, and they had made their escape—
33 Therefore, when the queen had received this message she sent unto Amialickiah, desiring him that he would spare the people of the city; and she also desired him that he should come in, unto her; and she also desired him that he~ should bring “witnesses with him to testify concerning the death of the king. 34. And it came to pass that Amalickiah took the same servant that slew the king, and all them who
30a Alma 55: 1. TG Fraud. 33a TG Witnesses.
(72 B.c.]
ALMA 47:35-48:7
were with him, and went in unto the queen, unto the place where she sat; and they all “testified unto her that the king was slain by his own servants; and they said also: They have fled; does not this testify against them? And thus they satis- fied the queen concerning the death of the king.
35 And it came to pass that Amalickiah sought the *favor of the queen, and took her unto him to wife; and thus by his "fraud, and by the assistance of his cunning servants, he ‘obtained the kingdom; yea, he was acknowledged king throughout all the land, among all the people of the Lamanites, who were 4composed of the Lamanites and the Lemuelites and the Ishmaelites, and all the dissenters of the Nephites, from the reign of Nephi down to the present time.
36 Now these “dissenters, having the same instruction and the same information of the Nephites, yea, having been instructed in the same *’knowledge of the Lord, neverthe- less, it is strange to relate, not long after their dissensions they became more hardened and ‘impenitent, and more wild, wicked and ferocious than the Lamanites—drinking in with the “traditions of the Laman- ites; giving way to “indolence, and all manner of lasciviousness; yea, entirely forgetting the Lord their God.

AND now it came to pass that, as | soon as *Amalickiah had obtained |

2 And thus he did inspire their |
hearts against the Nephites, inso- much that in the *latter end of the ‘nineteenth year of the reign of the judges, he having accomplished his designs thus far, yea, having been
made king over the Lamanites, he |
*sought also to ‘reign over all the land, yea, and all the people who
were in the land, the Nephites as |
wellas the Lamanites.
3 Therefore he had accomplished his design, for he had hardened the hearts of the Lamanites and blinded their minds, and stirred them up to anger, insomuch that he had gath- ered together a numerous host to go to battle against the Nephites.
4 For he was determined, because of the greatness of the number of his people, to “overpower the Nephites and to bring them into bondage.
5 And thus he did appoint “chief
captains of the °Zoramites, they ©
being the most acquainted with the strength of the Nephites, and their places of resort, and the weakest parts of their cities; therefore he appointed them to be chief captains over his armies.
6 And it came to pass that they took their camp, and moved forth toward the land of Zarahemla in the wilderness.
7 Now it came to pass that while Amalickiah had thus been obtaining power by fraud and deceit, Moroni, on the other hand, had been “pre-

paring the minds of the people to be faithful unto the Lord their God.
8 Yea, he had been strengthening the armies of the Nephites, and erecting small “forts, or places of resort; throwing up banks of earth round about to enclose his armies, and also building walls of stone to encircle them about, round about their cities and the borders of their lands; yea, all round about the land.
9 And in their weakest fortifica- tions he did place the greater num- ber of men; and thus he did fortify and strengthen the land which was possessed by the Nephites.
10 And thus he was preparing to "support their liberty, their lands, their wives, and their children, and their peace, and that they might live unto the Lord their God, and that they might maintain that which was called by their enemies the cause of Christians.
11 And Moroni was a “strong and a mighty man; he was a man of a perfect “understanding; yea, a man that did not delight in bloodshed; a man - whose soul-did joy in the liberty and the freedom. of his country, and his brethren from bondage and slavery ;
12 Yea, a man whose heart did swell with thanksgiving to his God, for the many privileges and bless- ings which he bestowed upon his people; a man who did. labor exceedingly for the “welfare and safety of his people.
13 Yea, and he was a man who was firm in the faith of Christ, and he had “sworn with an oath to defend his people, his rights, and “his country, and his religion, even to the loss of his blood.
14 Now the Nephites were taught
ALMA 48:8-19
to defend themselves against their enemies, even to the shedding of blood if it were necessary; yea, and they were also taught “never to give an offense, yea, and never to raise the sword except it were against an enemy, except it were to preserve their lives.
15 And this was their “faith, that by so doing God would “prosper them in the land, or in other words, if they were faithful in’keeping the commandments of God that he would prosper them in the land; yea, warn them to flee, or to pre- pare for war, according to their danger;
16 And also, that God would make it known unto them “whither they should go to defend themselves against their enemies, and by so doing, the Lord would deliver them; and this was the faith of Moroni, and his heart did glory in it; not in the ’shedding of blood but in doing good, in preserving his people, yea, in keeping the commandments of God, yea, and resisting iniquity.
17 Yea, verily, verily I say unto you, if all men had been, and were, and ever would be, like unto 2Moroni, behold, the very powers of hell would have been shaken for- ever; yea, the ’devil would never have power over the hearts of the children of men.
18 Behold, he was a man like unto 2Ammon, the son of Mosiah, yea, and even the other sons of Mosiah, yea, and also Alma and his sons, for they were all men of God.
19 Now behold, Helaman and his brethren were no less “serviceable unto the people than was Moroni; for they did preach the word of God, and they did baptize unto repent-

20 And thus they went forth, and the people did “humble themselves because of their “words, insomuch that they werehighly ‘favored of the Lord, and thus they were free from wars and contentions among them- selves, yea, even for the space of four years.
21 But, as I have said, in the ‘latter end of the nineteenth year, yea, notwithstanding their peace amongst themselves, they were compelled reluctantly to contend with their brethren, the Lamanites.
22 Yea, and in fine, their wars never did cease for the space of many years with the Lamanites, not- withstanding their much reluctance.
23 Now, they were “sorry to take up arms against the Lamanites, because they did not delight in the shedding of blood; yea, and this was not all—they were "sorry to be the means of sending so many of their brethren out of this world into an eternal world, ‘unprepared to meet their God.
24 Nevertheless, they could not suffer to lay down their lives, that their “wives and their children should be *massacred by the bar- barous ‘cruelty of those who were once their brethren, yea, and had 4dissented from their church, and had left them and had gone to destroy them by joining the La- manites.
25 Yea, they could not bear that their brethren should rejoice over the blood of the Nephites, so long as there were any who should keep the commandments of God, for the promise of the Lord was, if they should keep his commandments they should “prosper in the land.

CHAPTER 49
The invading Lamanites are unable to take the fortified cities of Ammon- — ihah and Noah—Amalickiah curses | God and swears to drink the blood of | Moroni—Helaman and his brethren | continue to strengthen the Church.
AND now it came to pass in the *eleventh month of the nineteenth year, on the tenth day of the month, the armies of the Lamanites were seen approaching towards the land of 7Ammonihah.
2 And behold, the city had been rebuilt, and Moroni had stationed an army by the borders of the city, and they had ’cast up dirt round about to shield them from the arrows and the ’stones of the La- manites; for behold, they fought with stones and with arrows.
3 Behold, I said that the city of 2Ammonihah had been rebuilt. I say unto you, yea, that it was in part rebuilt; and because the Lamanites had destroyed it once because of the iniquity of the people, they supposed that it would again become an easy prey for them.
4 But behold, how great was their disappointment; for behold, the Nephites had dug up a “ridge of earth round about them, which was so high that the Lamanites could not cast their stones and their arrows at them that they might take effect, neither could they come upon them save it was by their place of “entrance.
5 Now at this time the chief “cap- tains of the Lamanites were aston- ished exceedingly, because of the wisdom of the Nephites in pre- paring their places of security.
6 Now the leaders of the Laman-

ites had supposed, bécause of the greatness of their numbers, yea, they supposed that they should be privileged to come, upon them as they had hitherto done; yea, and they had also prepared themselves with shields, and with “breastplates ; and they had also prepared them- selves with garments of skins, yea, very thick garments to cover their nakedness.
7 And being thus prepared they. supposed that they should easily overpower and “subject their breth- ren to the yoke of bondage, or slay and.massacre them according to their pleasure.
8 But behold, to their uttermost astonishment, they were “prepared for them, in a manner which never had been. known among the chil- dren of Lehi. Now they were pre- pared for the Lamanites, to battle after the manner.of the instructions of Moroni.
9. And it came to pass thatthe Lamanites, or the Amalickiahites, were. exceedingly astonished at their manner of preparation for war.
10 Now, if king Amalickiah had come down out of the “land of Nephi, at the head of his army, perhaps he would-have caused the Lamanites to have attacked the Nephites at the city of Ammon- ihah; for behold, he did care not for the blood of his people.
11 But behold, Amalickiah did not come. down himself to battle..And behold, his chief captains durst not attack the Nephites at the city of Ammonihah, for Moroni had altered the management of. affairs among the Nephites, insomuch that the Lamanites were disappointed in their places. of retreat and they could not come upon them.
12 Therefore they retreated into the wilderness, and took their
ALMA 49:7-18
camp and marched towards the land of “Noah, supposing that to be the next best place for them to come against the Nephites.
13 For they knew not that Moroni had fortified, or had built “forts of security, for every city in all the land round about; therefore, they marched forward to the land of Noah with a firm determination; yea, their chief captains came for- ward and took an ’oath that they would destroy the people of that city.
14 But behold, to their astonish- ment, the city of Noah, which had hitherto been .a-weak place, had now, by the means of Moroni, be- come strong, yea, even to exceed the strength of the city Ammonihah.
15 And now, behold, this was wis- dom in Moroni; for he had supposed that they would be frightened at the city Ammonihah; and as the city of Noah had hitherto been the weakest part of the land, therefore they would march thither to battle; and thus it was according to his desires.
16. And» behold, - Moroni. had appointed Lehi to be chief captain over the men: of that city; and it was that ‘same Lehi who fought with the Lamanites in the valley on the east ofthe river Sidon.
17 And now. behold it came to pass, that when the Lamanites had found that. Lehi commanded the city they were again disappointed, for they feared - Lehi exceedingly ; nevertheless their. chief captains had “sworn with an oath to attack the. city; therefore, they brought up their armies.
18 Now behold, -the. Lamanites could not get into their forts of security by any other way save by the entrance, because of the high- ness of the bank: which had been thrown up, and the depth of the

ditch which had been dug round about, save it were by the entrance.
19 And thus were the Nephites prepared to destroy all such as should attempt to climb up to enter the fort by any other way, by cast- ing over stones and arrows at them.
20 Thus they were prepared, yea, a body of their strongest men, with their swords and their slings, to smite down all who should attempt to come into their place of security by the place of “entrance; and thus were they prepared to defend them- selves against the Lamanites.
21 And it came to pass that the captains of the Lamanites brought up their armies before the place of entrance, and began to contend with the Nephites, to get into their place of security; but behold, they were driven back from time to time, insomuch that they were slain with animmense slaughter.
22 Now when they found that they could not obtain power over the Nephites by the pass, they began to dig down their banks of earth that they might obtain a pass to their armies, that they might have an equal chance to fight; but behold, in these attempts they were swept off by the stones and arrows which were thrown at them; and instead of filling up their ditches by pulling down the banks of earth, they were filled up in a measure with their dead and wounded bodies.
23 Thus the Nephites had all power over their enemies; and thus the Lamanites did attempt to destroy the Nephites until their “chief cap- tains were all slain; yea, and more than a thousand of the Lamanites were slain; while, on the other hand, there was not a single soul of the Nephites which was slain.
24 There were about fifty who were wounded, who had been exposed to the arrows of the Lamanites through

the pass, but they were shielded by their “shields, and their breastplates, and their head-plates, insomuch that their wounds were upon their legs, many of which were very severe.
25 And it came to pass, that when the Lamanites saw that their chief captains were all slain they fled into the wilderness. And it came to pass that they returned to the. land of Nephi, to inform their king, Ama- lickiah, who was a *Nephite by birth, concerning their great "loss.
26 And it came to pass that he was exceedingly angry with his people, because he had not obtained his desire over the Nephites; he had not subjected them to the yoke of bondage.
27 Yea, he was exceedingly wroth, and he did “curse God, and also Moroni, swearing with an "oath that he would drink his blood; and this because Moroni had kept the com- mandments of God in preparing for the safety of his people.
28 And it came to:pass, that on the other hand, the people of Nephi did “thank the Lord their God, because of his matchless power in delivering them from the hands of their enemies.
29 And thus ended the nineteenth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.
30 Yea, and there was continual peace among them, and exceedingly great prosperity in the church be- cause of their heed and diligence which they gave unto the word of God, which was declared unto them by Helaman, and Shiblon, and Corianton, and Ammon and _ his brethren, yea, and by all those who had been ordained by the *holy order of God, being baptized unto repentance, and sent forth to preach among the people.

Moroni fortifies the lands of the Nephites—They build many new cities—Wars and destructions befell the Nephites in the days of. their wickedness and abominations—Mori- anton and his dissenters are defeated by Teancum—Nephihah dies and his son Pahoran fills the judgment-seat.
AND now it came to pass that Moroni did not stop making prepa- rations for war, or to defend his people against the Lamanites; for he caused that his armies should commence in the *commencement of the twentieth year of the reign of the judges, that they should com- mence in digging up “heaps of earth round about all the cities, through- out all the land which was possessed by. the Nephites.
2 And upon the top of these ridges of earth he caused that there should be “timbers, yea, works of timbers built up to the height of a man, round about the cities.
3 And he caused that upon those works of timbers there should be a frame of pickets built upon the timbers round about; and they were strong and high.
4 And he caused towers to be erected that overlooked those works of pickets, and he caused places of security to be built upon those “towers, that the stones and the arrows of the Lamanites could not hurt them.
5 And they were prepared that they could cast stones from the top thereof, according to their pleasure and their strength, and slay him who should attempt to approach near the walls of the city.
6 Thus Moroni did prepare strong- holds against the coming of their enemies, round about every city in all the land.
7 And it came to pass that Moroni

caused that his armies should go forth into the east wilderness; yea, and they went forth and drove all the Lamanites who were in the east wilderness into their own lands, which were “south of the land of Zarahemla.
8 And the land of “Nephi did run in a straight course from the east sea to the west.
9 And it came to pass that when Moroni had driven all the Lamanites out of the east wilderness, which was north of the lands of their own possessions, he caused that the inhabitants who were in the land of Zarahemla and in the land round about should go forth into the east wilderness, even to the borders by the seashore, and possess the land.
10 And he also placed armies on the south, in the borders of their possessions, and caused them to erect “fortifications that they might secure their armies and their people from the hands of their enemies.
11 And thus he cut off all the strongholds of the Lamanites in the east wilderness, yea, and also on the west, fortifying the line between the Nephites and the Lamanites, between the land of Zarahemla and the land of Nephi, from the west sea, running by the head of the “river Sidon—the Nephites possessing all the land "northward, yea, even all the land which was northward of the land Bountiful, according to their pleasure.
12 Thus Moroni, with his armies, which did increase daily because of the assurance of protection which his works did bring forth unto them, did seek to cut off the strength and the power of the Lamanites from off the lands of their possessions, that they should have no power upon the lands of their possession.
13 And it came to pass that the Nephites began the foundation of a

city, and they called the name of the city 7Moroni; and it was by the east sea; and it was on the south by the line of the possessions of the Lamanites.
14 And they also began a founda- tion for a city between the city of Moroni and the city of Aaron, join- ing the borders of Aaron and Moroni; and they called the name of the city, or the land, “Nephihah.
15 And they also began in that same year to build many cities on the north, one in a particular manner which they called *Lehi, which was in the north by the borders of the seashore. :
16 And thus ended the twentieth year.
17 And in these prosperous cir- cumstances were the people of Nephi in the *commencement of the twenty and first year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.
18 And they did prosper “exceed- ingly, and they became exceedingly rich; yea, and they did multiply and wax strong in the land.
19 And thus we see how merciful and just are all the dealings of the Lord, to the fulfilling of all his words unto the children of men; yea, we can behold that his words are veri- fied, even at this time, which he spake unto Lehi, saying:
20 Blessed art thou and thy chil- dren; and they shall be blessed, inas- much as they shall keep my “com- mandments they shall prosper in the land. But remember, inasmuch as they will not keep my command- ments they shall be °cut off from the presence of the Lord.
21 And we see that these promises have been verified to the people of Nephi; for it has been their quarrel- ings and their contentions, yea, their murderings, and their plunderings,

their idolatry, their whoredoms, and their abominations, which were among themselves, which *brought upon them their wars and their destructions.
22 And those who were faithful in keeping the commandments of the Lord were delivered at all times, whilst thousands of their wicked brethren have been consigned to bondage, or to perish by the sword, or to dwindle in unbelief, and mingle with the Lamanites.
23 But behold there never was a *happier time among the people of Nephi, since the days of Nephi, than in the days of Moroni, yea, even at this time, in the twenty and first year of the reign of the judges.
24 And it came to pass that the twenty and second year of the reign of the judges also ended in peace; yea, and also the twenty and third year.
25 And it came to pass that in the tTcommencement of the twenty and fourth year of the reign of the judges, there would also have been peace among the people of Nephi had it not been for a “contention which took place among them con- cerning the land of °Lehi, and the land of ‘Morianton, which joined upon the borders of Lehi; both of which were on the borders by the seashore.
26 For behold, the people who possessed the land of Morianton did claim a part of the land of Lehi; therefore there began to be a warm “contention between them, inso- much that the people of Morianton took up arms against their breth- ren, and they were determined by the sword to slay them.
27 But behold, the people who possessed the land of Lehi fled to the camp of Moroni, and appealed unto

335
him for assistance; fof behold they were not in the wrong.
28 And it came to pass that when the people of Morianton, who: were led by a man whose name was Morianton, found that the people of Lehi had fled to the camp of Moroni, they were exceedingly fearful lest the army of Moroni should come upon them and destroy them.
29 Therefore, Morianton put it into their hearts that they should flee to the land which was northward, which was. covered with “large bodies of water, and take possession of the land which was ’northward.
30 And behold, they would have carried this plan into effect, (which would. have been a cause to: have been lamented) but behold, Mori- anton being a man of much passion, therefore he was angry with one of his maid servants, and he fell upon her and beat her much.
31 And it, came to pass: that she fled, and came over to the camp of Moroni, and told Moroni all things concerning the matter, and also con- cerning their intentions to flee into the land northward.
32 Now behold, the people who were in the land Bountiful, or rather Moroni, feared that they would hearken to the words of Morianton and unite with his people, and thus he would obtain possession of those parts of the land, which would lay a foundation for serious consequences among the people of Nephi, yea, which “consequences would lead to the overthrow of their liberty.
33 Therefore Moroni sent an army, with their camp, to head the people of Morianton, to stop their flight into the land northward.
34 And it came to. pass that they did not “head them until they had
ALMA 50:28-39
come to the borders of) the land ’Desolation; and there they -did head them, by the» narrow ‘pass which led by the sea into the land northward, yea, by. the:sea, on the west and on the east.
35 And it came to pass that the army which was sent by Moroni, which was led by a man whose name was Teancum, did meet the people of Morianton; and so stubborn were the people of Morianton, (being inspired by his wickedness and his *flattering words) that a battle com- menced between them, in the which Teancum did slay Morianton and defeat his army, and took them prisoners, and returned to the camp of Moroni. And thus ended the twenty and fourth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.
36 And thus were the people of Morianton brought back. And upon their “covenanting to keep the peace they were restored to the land of Morianton, and a union took place between them and the people of Lehi; and they were also restored to their lands.
37 And it came to pass that:in the same year that the people of Nephi had peace restored unto them, that Nephihah, the “second chief judge, died, having filled the judgment- seat with “perfect uprightness before God.
38 Nevertheless, he had refused Alma to take possession of those “records and those things which were esteemed by Alma and his fathers to be most sacred; therefore Alma had conferred them upon his son, Helaman.
39 Behold, it came to pass that the son of Nephihah was appointed to fill the judgment-seat, in the stead of his father; yea, he was appointed.

chief judge and “governor over the people, with an ’oath and sacred ordinance to judge righteously, and to keep the peace and the “freedom of the people, and to grant unto them their sacred privileges to wor- ship the Lord their God, yea, to support and maintain the cause of God all his days, and to bring the wicked to justice according to their crime.
40° Now behold, his name was *Pahoran. And Pahoran did fill the seat of his father, and did com- mence his reign in the end of the twenty and fourth year, over the people of Nephi.
CHAPTER 51
The king-men seek to change the law and set up a king—Pahoran and the freemen are supported by the voice of the people— Moroni compels the king- men to defend their liberty or be put to death—Amialickiah and the Laman- ites capture many fortified cities— Teancum repels the Lamanite inva- sion and slays Amalickiah in his tent.
AND now it came to pass in the *commencement of the twenty and fifth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi, they hav- ing established peace between the people of Lehi and the people of Morianton concerning their lands, and having commenced the twenty and fifth year in “peace;
2 Nevertheless, they did not long maintain an entire peace in the land, for there began to be a contention among the people concerning the chief judge Pahoran; for behold, there were a part of the people who desired that a few particular points of the “law should be altered.
3 But behold, Pahoran would not alter nor suffer the law to be altered;

336
therefore, he did not hearken to those who had sent in their voices with their petitions concerning the altering of the law.
4 Therefore, those who were desirous that the law should be altered were angry with him, and desired that he should no longer be chief judge over the land; therefore there arose a warm “dispute con- cerning the matter, but not unto bloodshed.
5 And it came to pass that those who were desirous that Pahoran should be dethroned from the judgment-seat were called “king- men, for they were desirous that the law should be altered in a manner to overthrow the free government and to establish a °king over the land.
6 And those who were desirous that Pahoran should remain chief judge over the land took upon them the name of “freemen; and thus was the *division among them, for the free- men had sworn or ‘covenanted to maintain their rights and the privileges of their religion by a free government.
7 And it came to pass that this matter of their contention was settled by the “voice of the people. And it came to pass that the voice of the people came in favor of the freemen, and Pahoran retained the judgment-seat, which caused much rejoicing among the brethren of Pahoran and also many of the people of liberty, who also put the king-men to silence, that they durst not oppose but were obliged to maintain the cause of freedom.
8 Now those who were in favor of kings were those of “high birth, and they sought to be °kings; and they were supported by those who sought power and authority over the people.

9 But behold, this was a critical time for such contentions to be among the people of Nephi; for behold,. Amalickiah had again ¢stir- red.up the hearts of the people of the Lamanites against the people of the Nephites, and he was gathering together soldiers from all parts of his land, and arming them, and preparing for war with all diligence; for he had ’sworn to drink the blood of Moroni.
10. But behold, we shall see that his promise which he made was rash; nevertheless, he did prepare him- self and his armies to come to battle against the Nephites.
11. Now his armies were not -so great as they had hitherto. been, because of the many thousands who had been “slain by the hand of the Nephites; but notwithstanding their great loss, Amalickiah had gathered together-a, wonderfully great army, insomuch that he feared not. to come down to the land of Zarahemla.
12 Yea, even Amalickiah did him- self come down, at the head of the Lamanites. And it was in the twenty and fifth year of the reign of the judges; and it was at the same time that they had begun to settle the affairs of their contentions concern- ing the chief judge, Pahoran.
13 And it came to pass that when the men who were called king-men had heard that the Lamanites were coming down to battle against them, they. were glad in their hearts; and they refused to take up arms, for they were so wroth with the chief judge, and also with the “people of ‘liberty, that they would not take up arms to defend their country.
14 And it came to pass that when Moroni saw this, and also saw that the Lamanites were coming into the borders of the land, he was exceed- ingly wroth because of the “stub-
ALMA 51:9-20
bornness of those people whom he had labored with so much diligence to preserve; yea, he was exceedingly wroth; his soul was filled with anger against them..
15 And it came'to pass that he sent a petition, with the voice of the people, unto the governor of the land, desiring that he should read it, and give him (Moroni) power to com- pel those dissenters to defend their country or to put them to death.
16 For it was his first care to put an end to such contentions and dis- sensions among the people; for behold, this had been hitherto a cause of all their destruction. And it came to pass that it was granted according to the voice of the people.
17 And it came to pass that Moroni commanded that his army should go against those king-men, to pull down their pride and their nobility and level them with the earth, or they should take up arms and sup- port the cause of liberty.
18 And it came to pass that the armies did march forth against them; and they did pull down their pride and their nobility, insomuch that as they did lift their weapons of war to fight against the men of Moroni they were hewn down and leveled to the earth.
19 And it came to pass that there were four thousand of those @dis- senters who were hewn down by the sword; and those of their leaders who: were not slain in battle were taken and °cast into prison, for there was no time for their trials at this period.
20 And the remainder of those dis- senters, rather than be smitten down to the earth by the sword, yielded to the standard of liberty, and were compelled to hoist the “title of liberty upon their towers, and in their cities, and to take up arms in defence of their country.

ALMA 51:21-33
21 And thus Moroni put an end to those king-men, that there were not any known by the appellation of king-men; and thus he put an end to the stubbornness and the: pride of those people who professed the blood of nobility; but they were brought down to humble themselves like unto their brethren, and to fight “valiantly for their freedom from bondage.
22 Behold, it came to pass that while “Moroni was thus breaking down the wars and contentions among his own people, and subject- ing them to peace and civilization, and making regulations to prepare for war against the Lamanites, be- hold; the Lamanites had come into the land of Moroni, which was in the borders by the seashore.
23 And it came to pass that the Nephites were not sufficiently strong in the city of Moroni; there- fore Amalickiah did drive them, slaying many. And it came to pass that Amalickiah took possession of the city, yea, possession of all their fortifications.
24 And those who fled out of the *city of Moroni came to the city of Nephihah; and also the people of the city of Lehi gathered themselves together, and made preparations and were ready to receive the Lamanites to battle.
25 But it came to pass that Amalickiah would not suffer the Lamanites to go against the city of Nephihah to battle, but kept them down by the seashore, leaving men in every city to maintain and defend
it.
26 And thus he went on, taking possession of “many cities, the city of ’Nephihah, and the city of ‘Lehi, and the city of “Morianton, and the city of Omner, and the city of °Gid,

and the city of ‘Mulek, all of which were on the east borders by the seashore.
27 And thus had the Lamanites obtained, by the cunning of Amalic- kiah, so many cities, by their numberless hosts, all of which were strongly fortified after the manner of the “fortifications of Moroni; all of which afforded strongholds for the Lamanites.
28 And it came to pass that they marched to the “borders of the land Bountiful, driving the Nephites before them and slaying many.
29 But it came to pass that they were met by Teancum, who had “slain Morianton and had "headed his‘people in his flight.
30 And it came to pass that he headed Amalickiah also, as he was marching forth with his numerous army that he might take possession of the land Bountiful, and also the land ‘northward.
31 But behold he met with a dis- appointment by being repulsed by Teancum and his men, for they were great warriors; for every man of Teancum did exceed the Lamanites in their strength and in their skill of war, insomuch that they did gain advantage over the Lamanites.
32 And it came to pass that they did harass them, insomuch that they did slay them even until it was dark. And it came to pass that Teancum and his men did pitch their tents in the borders of the land Bountiful; and Amalickiah did pitch his tents in the borders on the beach by the seashore, and after this manner were they driven.
33 And it came to pass that when the night had come, Teancum and his servant stole forth and went out by night, and went into the camp of Amalickiah; and behold, sleep

had overpowered them because of their much fatigue, which was
caused by the labors and heat of the _
day.
34 And it came to pass that Tean- cum stole privily into the tent of the king, and “put a javelin to his heart; and he did cause the death of the king immediately that he did not awake his servants.
35 And he returned again privily to his own camp, and behold, his men were asleep, and he awoke them and told them all the things that he had done.
36 And he caused that his armies should stand in ¢readiness, lest the Lamanites' had awakened ~ and should come upon them.
37 And thus endeth the twenty and fifth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi; and thus endeth the days of Amalickiah.
CHAPTER. 52
Ammoron succeeds Amalickiah as king of the Lamanites—Moroni, Teancum, and Lehi lead the Nephites ina victorious war against the Laman- ites—The city of Mulek is retaken, and Jacob the Lamanite is slain.
AND now, it came to pass in the *twenty and sixth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi, behold, when the Lamanites awoke on the first morning of the first month, behold, they found Amalickiah was dead in his own tent; and they also saw that Tean- cum was “ready to give them battle on that day.
2 And now, when the Lamanites saw this they were affrighted; and they abandoned their design in marching into the land northward, and retreated with all their army into the city of *Mulek, and sought protection in their fortifications. 34a Alma 62: 36. 54:5.

3 And it came to pass that the *brother of Amalickiah was appoin- ted king over the people; and his name was ’Ammoron; thus: king Ammoron, the. brother of. king Amalickiah, was appointed to reign in his stead.
4 And it came to pass that he did command that his people should maintain those cities, which they had taken by the shedding of blood; for they had not taken any cities save they had lost much blood.
5 And now, Teancum saw that the Lamanites were determined to Maintain those cities which they had taken, and those parts of the land which they had obtained pos- session of; and also seeing the enormity of their number, Teancum thought it was not expedient that he should attempt to attack them in their forts.
6 But he kept his men round about, as if making preparations for war; yea, and truly he was preparing to defend himself against them, by “casting up walls round about and preparing places of resort.
7 And it came to pass that he kept thus preparing for war until Moroni had sent a large number of men to strengthen his army.
8 And Moroni also. sent orders unto him that he should retain all the prisoners who fell into his hands; for as the Lamanites had taken many prisoners, that he. should retain all the prisoners of the La- manites as a*ransom for thosewhom the Lamanites had taken.
9 And he also sent orders unto him that he should fortify the land “Bountiful, and secure the "narrow pass which led into the land ‘north- ward, lest the Lamanites should obtain that point and should have power to harass them on every side.

[*66 B.c.]
ALMA 52:10-21
10 And Moroni also sent unto him, desiring him that he would be “faith- ful in maintaining that quarter of the land, and that he would seek every opportunity to scourge the Lamanites in that quarter, as much as was in his power, that perhaps he might take again by stratagem or some other way those cities which had been taken out of their hands; and that he also would fortify and strengthen the cities round about, which had not fallen into the hands of the Lamanites.
11 And he also said unto him, I would come unto you, but behold, the Lamanites are upon us in the borders of the land by the west sea; and behold, I go against them, therefore I cannot come unto you.
12 Now, the king (Ammoron) had “departed out of the land of Zara- hemla, and had made known unto the queen concerning the death of his brother, and had gathered to- gether a large number of men, and had marched forth against the Nephites on the borders by the west sea.
13 And thus he was endeavoring to harass the Nephites, and to draw away a part of their forces to that part of the land, while he had com- manded those whom he had left to possess the cities which he had taken, that they should also harass the Nephites on the borders by the east sea, and should take possession of their lands as much as it was in their power, according to the power of their armies.
14 And thus were the Nephites in those dangerous circumstances in the ending of the twenty and sixth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.
15 But behold, it came to pass in the *twenty and seventh year of the reign of the judges, that Teancum, by the command of Moroni—who had established armies to protect the south and the west borders of the land, and had begun his march

19a Alma 49: 5; 55: 23. 20a Alma 48: 5.
340 |
towards the land Bountiful, that he might assist Teancum with his men
in retaking the cities which they
had lost—
16 And it came to pass that Tean- |
cum had received orders to make an attack upon the city of Mulek, and retake it if it were possible.
17 And it came to pass that Teancum made preparations to make an attack upon the city of Mulek, and march forth with his army against the Lamanites; but he saw that it was impossible that he could overpower them while they
were in their fortifications; there- |
fore he abandoned his designs and returned again to the city Bountiful, to wait for the coming of Moroni, that he might receive strength to his army.
18 And it came to pass that Moroni did arrive with his army at the land of Bountiful, in the latter end of the twenty and seventh year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.
19 And in the fcommencement of the twenty and eighth year, Moroni and Teancum and many of the chief “captains held a council of war— what they should do to cause the Lamanites to come out against them to battle; or that they might by some means flatter them out of their strongholds, that they might gain advantage over them and take again the city of Mulek.
20 And it came to pass they sent embassies to the army of the La- manites, which protected the city of Mulek, to their leader, whose name was Jacob, desiring him that he would come out with his armies to meet them upon the plains between the two cities. But behold, Jacob, who was a “Zoramite, would not come out with his army to meet them upon the plains.
21 Andit came to pass that Moroni, having no hopes of meeting them upon fair grounds, therefore, he resolved upon a plan that he might

*decoy the Lamanites out of their strongholds.
22 Therefore he caused that Tean- cum should take a.small number of men and march down near the sea- shore; and Moroni and his army, by night, marched in the wilderness, on the west of the city *Mulek; and thus, on the morrow, when the guards of the Lamanites had dis- covered Teancum, they ran and told it unto Jacob, their leader.
23 And it came to pass that the armies of the Lamanites did march forth against Teancum, supposing by their numbers to overpower Teancum because of the smallness of hisnumbers. And as Teancum saw the armies of the Lamanites coming out against him he began to retreat down by the seashore, northward.
24 And it came to pass that when the Lamanites saw that he began to flee, they took courage and pursued them. with vigor. And while Tean- cum was thus leading away the Lamanites who were pursuing them in vain, behold, Moroni commanded that a part of his army who were with him should march forth into the city, and take possession of it.
25 And thus they did, and slew all those who had. been left to pro- tect the city, yea, all. those who would not “yield up their weapons of war.
26 And thus Moroni had obtained possession of the city Mulek with a part of his army, while he marched with the remainder to meet the Lamanites when they should return from the pursuit of Teancum.
27 And it came to pass that the Lamanites did pursue Teancum until they came near the city Bountiful, and then they were met by Lehi and a small army, which had been left to protect the city Bountiful.
28 And now behold, when the chief captains of the Lamanites had be- held Lehi with his army coming
ALMA 52:22-37
against them, they fled in much con- fusion, lest perhaps they should not obtain the city Mulek before Lehi should overtake them; for they were wearied because of their march, and the men of Lehi were fresh.
29 Now the Lamanites did not know that Moroni had been in their rear with his army; and all they feared was Lehi and his men.
30 Now Lehi was not desirous to overtake them till they should meet Moroniand his army.
31 And it came to pass that before the Lamanites had retreated far they were surrounded by the Ne- phites, by the men of Moroni on one hand, and the men of Lehi on the other, all of whom were fresh and full of strength; but the Lamanites were wearied because of their long march.
32 And Moroni commanded his men that they should fall upon them until they had given up. their weapons of war.
33 And it came'to pass that Jacob, being their leader, being also a ¢Zoramite, and having an uncon- querable spirit, he led the Laman- ites forth to battle with exceeding fury against Moroni.
34 Moroni being in their course of march, therefore Jacob was deter- mined to slay them and cut his way through to the city of Mulek. But behold, Moroni and his men were more powerful; therefore they did not give way before the Lamanites.
35 And. it came to pass that they fought on both hands with exceed- ing fury ; and there were many slain on both sides; yea, and Moroni was wounded and Jacob was killed.
36 And. Lehi pressed upon their rear with such fury with his strong men, that the Lamanites in the rear delivered up their weapons of war; and the remainder of them, being much confused, knew not whither to go or to strike.
37 Now Moroni seeing their con-

fusion, he said unto them: If ye will bring forth your weapons of war and deliver them up, behold we will forbear shedding your blood.
38 And it came to pass that when the Lamanites had heard these words, their chief captains, all those who were not slain, came forth and threw down their weapons of war 2at the feet of Moroni, and also com- manded their men that they should do the same.
39 But behold, there were many that would not; and those who would not deliver up their swords were taken and bound, and their weapons of war were taken from them, and they were compelled to march with their brethren forth into the land Bountiful.
40 And now the number of pris- oners who were taken exceeded more than the number of those who had been slain, yea, more than those who had been slain on both sides.
CHAPTER 53
The Lamanite prisoners are used to fortify the city Bountiful—Dissen- sions among the Nephites give rise to Lamanite victories—Helaman takes command of the two thousand strip- ling sons of the people of Ammon.
AND it came to pass that they did set guards over the prisoners of the Lamanites, and did compel them to go forth and bury their dead, yea, and also the dead of the Nephites who were slain; and Moroni placed men over them to guard them while they should perform their labors.
2 And “Moroni went to the city of Mulek with Lehi, and took com- mand of the city and gave it unto Lehi. Now behold, this Lehi was a man who had been with Moroni in the more part of all his battles; and he was a man like unto Moroni, and they rejoiced in each other’s safety ; yea, they were beloved by each

other, and also beloved by all the people of Nephi.
3 And it came to pass that after the Lamanites had finished burying their dead and also the dead of the © Nephites, they were marched back | into the land Bountiful; and Tean- cum, by the orders of Moroni, caused that they should commence laboring in “digging a ditch round about the land, or the city, "Bounti- ful.
4 And he caused that they should build a “breastwork of timbers upon the inner bank of the ditch; and they cast up dirt out of the ditch against | the breastwork of timbers; and thus they did cause the Lamanites to labor until they had encircled the city of Bountiful round about with a strong wall of timbers and earth, to an exceeding height.
5 And this city became an exceed- ing stronghold ever after; and in this city they did guard the prison- ers of the Lamanites; yea, even within a wall which they had caused them to “build with their own hands. Now Moroni was compelled to cause the Lamanites to labor, be- cause it was easy to guard them while at their labor; and he desired all his forces when he should make an attack upon the Lamanites.
6 And it came to pass that Moroni had thus gained a victory over one of the greatest of the armies of the Lamanites, and had obtained pos- session of the city of *Mulek, which was one of the strongest holds of the Lamanites in the land of Nephi; and thus he had also built a stronghold to retain his prisoners.
7 And it came to pass that he did no more attempt a battle with the Lamanites in that year, but he did employ his men in preparing for war, yea, and in making fortifications to guard against the Lamanites, yea, and also delivering their women and their children from famine and

affliction, and -providing food for their armies. ;
8 And now it came to pass that the armies of the Lamanites, on the west sea, south, while in the absence of Moroni on account of some in- trigue amongst the Nephites, which caused “dissensions amongst them, had gained some ground over the Nephites, yea, insomuch that they had obtained possession of a num- ber of their cities in that part of the land.
9 And thus because of “iniquity amongst themselves, yea, because of dissensions and intrigue among themselves they were placed in the most dangerous circumstances.
10 And now behold, I have some- what to say concerning the “people of Ammon, who, in the beginning, were Lamanites; but by Ammon and his brethren, or rather by, the power and word of God, they had been ’converted unto the Lord; and they had been brought down into the land of Zarahemla, and had ever since . been protected by _ the Nephites.
11 And because of their oath they had been kept from taking up arms against their brethren; for they had taken an oath that they “never would shed blood more; and accord- ing to their oath they would have perished; yea, they would have suffered themselves to have fallen into the hands of their brethren, had it not been for the pity and the exceeding love which Ammon and his brethren had had for them.
12 And for this cause they were brought down into the land. of Zarahemla; and.they ever had been *protected by the Nephites.
13 But it came to pass that when they saw the danger, and the many “afflictions and tribulations which the Nephites bore for them, they

were moved with compassion and were "desirous to take up arms in the defence of their country.
14 But behold, as they were about to take their weapons of war, they were overpowered by the persua- sions of Helaman.and his brethren, for they were about to “break the ’oath which they had made.
15 And Helaman feared lest by so doing they should lose their souls; therefore all those who had entered into this covenant. were compelled to. behold their. brethren - wade through. their afflictions, in their dangerous circumstances. at this time.
16 But behold, it came to pass they had many .’sons,..who. had not entered into a covenant that they would not take their weapons of war to defend themselves against their enemies; therefore they did assemble themselves together at this time, as many as were able to take up arms, and they called them- selves Nephites.
17 And they entered into a cove- nant to fight for the liberty of the Nephites, yea, to protect the land unto. the “laying down of their lives; yea, even. they. covenanted that they. never would give up their ‘liberty, but they would fight in all cases.to protect the Nephites and themselves from bondage.
18..Now behold, there were. two thousand of those young men, who entered into this covenant and took their weapons of war to defend their country.
19 And now behold, as they never had hitherto been a disadvantage to the Nephites, they became now at this period of time also a great sup- port; for they took their weapons of war, and they would that Helaman should be their leader.
20 And they were all young men,

and they were exceedingly valiant for *courage, and also for strength and activity; but behold, this was not all—they were men who were true at all times in whatsoever thing they were entrusted.
21 Yea, they were men of truth and “soberness, for they had been taught to keep the commandments of God and to °walk uprightly before him.
22 And now it came to pass that Helaman did march at the head of his “two thousand stripling soldiers, to the support of the people in the borders of the land on the south by the west sea.
23 And thus ended the twenty and eighth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.
CHAPTER 54
Ammoron and Moroni negotiate for the exchange of prisoners—Moroni demands that the Lamanites with- draw and. cease their murderous attacks—Ammoron demands that the Nephites lay down their arms. and become subject to the Lamanites.
AND now it came to pass in the *commencement of the twenty and ninth year of the judges, that “Ammoron sent unto Moronidesiring that he would exchange prisoners. 2 And it came to pass that Moroni felt to “rejoice exceedingly at this request, for he desired the provi- sions which were imparted for the support of the Lamanite prisoners for the support of his own people; and he also desired his own people for the strengthening of his army. 3 Now the Lamanites had taken many women and children, and there was not a woman nor a child among all the prisoners of Moroni, or the prisoners whom Moroni had taken; therefore Moroni resolved upon a stratagem to obtain as
344
many prisoners of the Nephites from the Lamanites as it were possible.
4 Therefore he wrote an epistle, and sent it by the servant of Ammoron, the same who had brought an epistle to Moroni. Now these are the words which he wrote unto Ammoron, saying:
5 Behold, Ammoron, I have writ- ten unto you somewhat concerning this war which ye have waged against my people, or rather which thy “brother hath waged against them, and which ye are still deter- mined to carry on after his death.
6 Behold, I would tell you some- what concerning the “justice of God, and the sword of his almighty wrath, which doth hang over you except ye repent and withdraw your armies into your own lands, or the land of your possessions, which is the land of Nephi.
7 Yea, I would teil you these things if ye were capable of hearkening unto them; yea, I would tell you concerning that awful “hell that awaits to receive such murderers as thou and thy brother have been, except ye repent and withdraw your murderous purposes, and return with your armies to your own lands.
8 But as ye have once rejected these things, and have fought against the people of the Lord, even so I may expect you will do it again.
9 And now behold, we are prepared to receive you;-yea, and except you withdraw your purposes, behold, ye will pull down the “wrath of that God whom you have rejected upon you, even to your utter destruction.
10 But, as the Lord liveth, our armies shall come upon you except ye withdraw, and ye shall soon be visited with “death, for we will retain our cities and our lands; yea,

and we will maintain our religion and the cause of our God.
11 But behold, it supposeth me that I talk to you concerning these things in vain; or-it supposeth me that thou art a °child of hell; there- fore I will close my epistle by telling you that I will not exchange prison- ers, Save it be on conditions that ye will deliver up a man and his wife and his children, for one prisoner; if this be the case that ye will do it, I willexchange.
12 And behold, if ye do not this, I will come against you with my armies; yea, even I will arm my women and my children, and I will come against you, and I will follow you even into your own land, which is the land of “our first inheritance; yea, and it shall be blood for blood, yea, life for life; and I will give you battle even until you are destroyed from off the face of the earth.
13 Behold, Iam in my anger, and also my people; ye have sought to *murder us, and we have only sought to defend ourselves. But behold, if ye seek to destroy us more we will seek to destroy you; yea, and we will seek our land, the land of our first inheritance.
14 Now I close my epistle. I am Moroni; I ama leader of the people of the Nephites.
15 Now it came to pass that Ammoron, when he had received this: epistle, was angry; and he wrote another epistle unto Moroni, and these are the words which he wrote, saying:
16 Iam Ammoron, the king of the Lamanites; I am the brother of Amalickiah whom ye have *mur- dered. Behold, I will avenge his blood upon you, yea, and I will come upon you with my armies for I fear not your threatenings.
17 For behold, your fathers did wrong their brethren, insomuch that

they did rob them of their “right to the °government when it rightly belonged unto them.
18 And now behold, if ye will lay down your arms, and subject your- selves to be governed by those to whom the government doth rightly belong, then will I cause that my people shall lay down their weap- ons and shall be at war no more.
19 Behold, ye have breathed out many threatenings against me and my people; but behold, we fear not your threatenings.
20 Nevertheless, I will grant to exchange prisoners according to your réquest, gladly, that I may preserve my food for my men of war; and we will wage a war which shall be eternal, either to the sub- jecting the Nephites to our author- ity or to their eternal extinction.
21 And as concerning that God whom ye say we have rejected, behold, we “know not such a being; neither do ye; but if it so be that thereis sucha being, we knownot but that he hath made us as well as you.
22 And if it so be that there is a devil and a hell, behold will he not send you there to dwell with my brother whom ye have murdered, whom ye have hinted that he hath gone to such a place? But behold these things matter not.
23 Iam Ammoron, and a descend- ant of *Zoram, whom your fathers pressed and brought out of Jeru- salem.
24 And behold now, I am a bold Lamanite; behold, this war hath been waged to avenge their wrongs, and “to maintain and to obtain their rights to the government; and I closemy epistle to Moroni.
CHAPTER 55
Moroni refuses to exchange prison- ers—The Lamanite guards are en-

[About 63 B.c.]
ALMA 55:1-17
ticed to become drunk, and the Nephite prisoners are freed—The city of Gid is taken without bloodshed.
Now it came to pass that when Moroni had received this epistle he was more angry,: because he knew that Ammoron had a perfect knowl- edge of his “fraud; yea, he knew that Ammoron Knew that it was not a just cause that had caused him to
wage a war against the people of
Nephi.
2 And he said: Behold, I will not exchange prisoners with Ammoron save he will withdraw his “purpose, as I have stated in my epistle; for I will not grant unto him that he shall have any more power than what he hath got.
3 Behold, I know the place where the Lamanites do guard my people whom they have taken prisoners; and as Ammoron would not grant unto me mine epistle, behold, I will give unto him according to my words; yea, I will seek death among them until they shall sue for peace.
4 And now it came to pass that when Moroni had said these words, he caused that a search should be made among his men, that perhaps he might find a man who was a descendant of Laman among them.
5 And it came to pass that they found one, whose name was La- man;and he was “one of the servants of the king who was murdered by Amalickiah.
6 Now Moroni caused that Laman and a small number of his men should go forth unto the guards who were over the Nephites.
7 Now the Nephites were guarded in the city of “%Gid; therefore Moroni appointed Laman and caused that a small number of men should go with him.
8 And when it was evening Laman went to the guards who were over the Nephites, and behold, they saw

him coming and they hailed him; but he saith unto them: Fear not; behold, 1 am a Lamanite. Behold, we have escaped from the Nephites, and they sleep; and behold we have taken of their wine and brought with
us.
9 Now when the Lamanites heard these words they received him with joy; and they said unto him: Give us of your wine, that we may drink; we are glad that ye have thus taken wine with you for we are weary.
10 But Laman said unto them: Let us keep of our wine till we go against the Nephites to battle. But this saying only made them more desirous to drink of the wine;
11 For, said they: We are weary, therefore let us take of the wine, and by and by we shall receive wine for our rations, which will strength- en us to go against the Nephites.
12 And Laman said unto them: You may do according to your desires.
13 And it came to pass that they did take of the wine freely; and it was pleasant to their taste, there- fore they took of it more freely ; and it was strong, having been pre- pared in its “strength.
14 And it came to pass they did drink and were merry, and by and by they were all “drunken.
15 And now when Laman and his men saw that they were all drunken, and were in a “deep sleep, they returned to Moroni and told him all the things that had happened.
16 And now this was according to the design of Moroni. And Moroni had prepared his men with weapons of war; and he went to the city Gid, while the Lamanites were in a deep sleep and drunken, and cast in “weapons of war unto the prisoners, insomuch that they were all armed;
17 Yea, even to their women, and all those of their children, as many as were able to use a weapon of war,
Mosiah 24: 19. 16a Alma 62: 22 (21-23).
[About 63 B.c.]
347
when Moroni had. armed all those prisoners; and all those things were done ina profound silence.
18 But had they awakened the Lamanites, behold they were drunk- en and the Nephites could have slain them. :
19. But behold, this was not the desire of Moroni; he did not @delight in. murder or bloodshed, but he delighted in the saving of his people from destruction; and for this cause he might not bring upon him in- justice, he would not fall upon the Lamanites and destroy them in their drunkenness.
20 But he had obtained his desires ; for he had armed those prisoners of the Nephites who were within the wall of the city, and had given them power to gain possession of those parts which were within the walls.
21 And then he caused the men who were with him to withdraw a pace from them, and surround the armies of the Lamanites.
22 Now behold this was done in the night-time, so that when the La- manites awoke in the morning they beheld that they were surrounded by the Nephites without, and that their prisoners were armed within.
23 And thus they saw that. the Nephites had power over them; and in these circumstances they found that it was not expedient that they should fight with the Nephites; therefore their chief “captains de- manded their weapons of war, and they, brought them forth and °cast them at the, feet of the Nephites, pleading for mercy.
24 Now behold, this was the desire of Moroni. He took them prisoners of war, and took possession of the city, and caused that all the prison- ers should be liberated, who were Nephites; and they did join the army of Moroni, and were a great strength to his army.

25 And it came to pass that he did cause the Lamanites, whom he had taken prisoners, that they should commence a “labor in strengthening the fortifications round about the city Gid.
26 And it came to pass that when he had fortified the city Gid, accord- ing to his desires, he caused that his prisoners should be taken to the city Bountiful; and he also guarded that city with an exceedingly strong force.
27 And it came to pass that they did, notwithstanding all the in- trigues of the Lamanites, keep and protect all the prisoners whom they had taken, and also maintain all the ground and the advantage which they had retaken.
28 And it came to pass that the Nephites began “again to be vic- torious, and to reclaim their rights and their privileges.
29 Many times did the Lamanites attempt to encircle them about by night, but in these attempts they did lose many prisoners.
30 And many. times did they attempt to administer of their wine to the Nephites, that they might destroy them with poison or with drunkenness.
31 But behold, the Nephites were not slow to “remember the Lord their God in this their time of afflic- tion. They could not be taken in their snares; yea, they would not partake of their wine, save they had first given to some of the Lamanite prisoners.
32 And they were thus cautious that no poison should be adminis- tered among them; for if their wine would poison a Lamanite it would also poison a» Nephite; and thus they did try all their liquors.
33 And now it came to pass that it was expedient for Moroni to make preparations to attack the city *“Morianton; for behold, the Laman-

ites had, by their labors, fortified the city Morianton until it had become an exceeding stronghold.
34 And they were continually bringing new forces into that city, and also new supplies of provisions.
35 And thus ended the twenty and ninth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.
CHAPTER 56
Helaman sends an epistle to Moroni recounting the state of the war with the Lamanites—Antipus and Helaman gain a great victory over the Laman- ites—Helaman’s two thousand strip- ling sons fight with miraculous power and none of them are slain.
AND now it came to pass in the *commencement of the thirtieth year of the reign of the judges, on the second day in the first month, *Moroni received an "epistle from Helaman, stating the affairs of the people in ‘that quarter of the land.
2 And these are the words which he wrote, saying: My dearly beloved brother, Moroni, as well in the Lord as in the tribulations of our war- fare; behold, my beloved brother, I have somewhat to tell you concern- ing our warfare in this part of the land.
3 Behold, “two thousand of the sons of those men whom Ammon brought down out of the land of Nephi—now ye have known that these were descendants of Laman, who was the eldest son of our father Lehi;
4 Now I need not rehearse unto you concerning their traditions or their unbelief, for thou knowest con- cerning all these things—
5 Therefore it sufficeth me that I tell you that two thousand of these young men have taken their weap- ons of war, and would that I should

be their leader; and we have come forth to defend our country.
6 And now ye also know concern- ing the %covenant which their fathers made, that they would not take up their weapons of war against their brethren to shed blood.
7 But in the twenty and sixth year, when they saw our afflictions and our tribulations for them, they were about to “break the covenant which they had made and take up their weapons of war in our defence.
8 But I would not suffer them that they should break this “covenant which they had made, supposing that God would strengthen us, insomuch that we should not suffer more because of the fulfilling the boath which they had taken.
9 But behold, here is one thing in which we may have great joy. For behold, in the ftwenty and sixth year, I, Helaman, did march at the head of these “two thousand young men to the city of °Judea, to assist Antipus, whom ye had appointed a leader over the people of that part of the land.
10 And I did join my two thousand ‘sons, (for they are worthy to be called sons) to the army of Antipus, in which strength Antipus did re- joice exceedingly; for behold, his army had been reduced by the Lamanites because their forces had slain a vast number of our men, for which cause we have to mourn.
11 Nevertheless, we may console ourselves in this point, that they have died in the cause of their country and of their God, yea, and they are “happy.
12 And the Lamanites had also retained many prisoners, all of whom are chief “captains, for none other have they spared alive. And we suppose that they are now at this

[*62 B.c. +66 8B.c.]
349 an
time in the land of Nephi; it is so if they are not slain.
13 And now these are the cities of which the Lamanites have obtained possession by the shedding of the blood of so many of our valiant men;
14 The land of *Manti, or the city of Manti, and the city of Zeezrom, and the city of >Cumeni, and the city of Antiparah.
15 And these are the cities which they possessed when I arrived at the city of Judea; and I found Antipus and his men toiling with their might to fortify the city.
16 Yea, and they were depressed in body as well as in spirit, for they had fought valiantly by day and toiled by night to maintain their cities; and thus they had suffered great afflictions of every kind.
17 And now they were determined to conquer in this place or die; there- fore you may well suppose that this little force which I brought with me, yea, those “sons of mine, gave them great hopes and much joy.
18 And now it came to pass that when the Lamanites saw that Antipus had received a greater strength to his army, they were compelled by the orders of Ammoron to not come against the city of Judea, or against us, to battle.
19 And thus were we favored of the Lord; for had they come upon us in this our weakness they might have perhaps destroyed our little army; but thus were we preserved.
20 They were commanded by Ammoron to maintain those. cities which they had taken. And thus ended the twenty and sixth year. And in the *commencement of the twenty and seventh year we had prepared our city and ourselves for defence.
21 Now we were desirous that the Lamanites should come upon us; for we were not desirous to make an attack upon them in their strong- holds.
14a Alma 43: 22. 17a Alma 56:
b Alma 57:7 (7-34).
ALMA 56:13-30
22 And it came to pass that we kept spies out round about, to watch the movements of the La- manites, that they might not pass us by night nor by day to make an attack upon our other cities which were on the northward.
23 For we knew in those cities they were not sufficiently strong to meet them; therefore we were desirous, if they should pass by us, to fall upon them in their rear, and thus bring them up in the rear at the same time they were met in the front. We supposed that we could overpower them; but behold; we were dis- appointed in this our desire.
24 They durst not pass by us with their whole army, neither durst they with a part, lest they should not be sufficiently strong and they: should fall.
25 Neither durst they march down against the city of Zarahemla; neither durst they cross the head of Sidon, over to the city of Nephihah.
26 And thus, with their forces, they were determined to maintain those cities which they had taken.
27 And now it came to pass in the second month of this year, there was brought unto us many pro- visions from the fathers of those my two thousand sons.
28 And also there were sent two thousand men unto us from the land of Zarahemla. And thus we were prepared with ten thousand men, and provisions for them, and: also for their wives and their children.
29 And the Lamanites, thus seeing our forces increase daily, and pro- visions arrive for our support, they began to be fearful, and began to sally forth, if it were possible to put an end to our receiving provisions and strength.
30 Now when we saw that the Lamanites began to grow uneasy on this wise, we were desirous to bring a stratagem into effect upon them; therefore Antipus ordered that I should march forth with my
[*65 B.c.]
ALMA 56:31-47
little sons to a neighboring city, “as if we were carrying provisions to a neighboring city.
31 And we were to march near the city of Antiparah, as if we were going to the city beyond, in the borders by the seashore.
32 And it came to pass that we did march forth, as if with our pro- visions, to go to that city.
33 And it came to pass that Antipus did march forth with a part of his army, leaving the remainder to maintain the city. But he did not march forth until I had gone forth with my little army, and came near the city Antiparah.
34 And now, in the city Antiparah were stationed the strongest army of the Lamanites; yea, the most numerous.
35 And it came to pass that when they had been informed by their spies, they came forth with their army and marched against us.
36 And it came to pass that we did flee before them, northward. And thus we did lead away the most powerful army of the Lamanites;
37 Yea, even to a considerable distance, insomuch that when they saw the army of Antipus pursuing them, with their might, they did not turn to the right nor to the left, but pursued their march in a straight course after us; and, as we suppose, it was their intent to slay us before Antipus should overtake them, and this that they might not be sur- rounded by our people.
38 And now Antipus, beholding our danger, did speed the march of his army. But behold, it was night; therefore they did not overtake us, neither did Antipus overtake them; therefore we did camp for the night.
39 And it came to pass that before the dawn of the morning, behold, the Lamanites were pursuing us. Now we were not sufficiently strong to contend with them; yea, I would

not suffer that my little sons should fall into their hands; therefore we did continue our march, and we took our march into the wilderness.
40 Now they durst not turn to the right nor to the left lest they should be surrounded; neither would I turn to the right nor to the left lest they should overtake me, and we could not stand against them, but be slain, and they would make their escape; and thus we did flee all that day into the wilderness, even until it was dark.
41 And it came to pass that again, when the light of the morning came we saw the Lamanites upon us, and we did flee before them.
42 But it came to pass that they did not pursue us far before they halted; and it was in the morning of the third day of the seventh month.
43 And now, whether they were overtaken by Antipus we knew not, but I said unto my men: Behold, we know not but they have-halted for the purpose that we should come against them, that they might catch us in their snare;
44 Therefore what say ye, my sons, will ye go against them to battle?
45 And now I say unto you, my beloved brother Moroni, that never had I seen “so great courage, nay, not amongst all the Nephites.
46 For as I had ever called them my sons (for they were all of them very young) even so they said unto me: Father, behold our God is with us, and he will ‘not suffer that we should fall; then let us go forth; we would not slay our brethren if they would let us alone; therefore let us go, lest they should overpower the army of Antipus.
47 Now they never had fought, yet they did not fear death; and they did think more upon the ‘liberty of their *fathers than they did upon their lives; yea, they had

been taught by their “mothers, that if they did not doubt, God would deliver them.
48 And they rehearsed unto me the words of their “mothers, saying: We *do not doubt our mothers. knew
it.
49 And it came to pass that I did return with my two. thousand against these Lamanites who had pursued us. And now behold, the armies of Antipus had overtaken them, anda terrible battle had commenced.
50 The army of Antipus being weary, because of their long march in so short a space of time, were about: to fall into the hands of the Lamanites; and had I not returned with my two thousand they would have obtained their purpose.
51 For Antipus had fallen by the sword, and many of his -leaders, because of their weariness, which was occasioned by the speed of their march—therefore the men of Anti- pus, being confused because of the fall of their leaders, began to give way before the Lamanites.
52 And it came to pass that the Lamanites took courage, and began to pursue them; and thus were the Lamanites.. pursuing them with great vigor when *Helaman came upon. their rear with his two thou- sand, and began to: slay them exceedingly, insomuch that the whole army of the Lamanites halted and turned upon Helaman.
53 Now when the people of Anti- pus saw that the Lamanites had turned them about, they gathered together their men and came again upon the rear of the Lamanites.
54And nowit came to pass that we, the people of Nephi, the people of Antipus, and I with my. two thou- sand, did surround the Lamanites, and. did slay them; yea, insomuch that they were compelled to deliver

up their weapons of war and also themselves as prisoners of war.
55 And now it came to pass that when they had surrendered them- selves up unto us, behold, I num- bered those young men who: had fought with me, fearing lest. there were many of them slain.
56 But behold, to my great joy, there had “not one soul of them fal- len to the earth; yea, and they had fought as if with the ’strength of God; yea, never were men known to have fought with such miraculous strength; and with such mighty power -did they. fall upon the Lamanites, that they did frighten them; and for this cause did the Lamanites deliver themselves up as prisoners of war.
57 And as we had.no place for our prisoners, that we could guard them to keep them from the armies of the Lamanites, therefore we sent them to the land of Zarahemla, and a part of those men who were not slain of Antipus, with them; and the re- mainder I took and joined them. to my stripling “Ammonites, and took our march back to the city of Judea.
CHAPTER 57
Helaman recounts the taking of Antiparah and the surrender and later the defense of Cumeni—His Ammonite striplings fight valiantly and all are wounded, but none are slain—Gid reports the slaying and the escape of the Lamanite prisoners.
AND now it came to pass that I received an epistle from Ammoron, the king, stating that if I would deliver up those prisoners. of war whom we had taken that he would deliver up the city of Antiparah unto us.
2 But I sent an epistle unto. the king, that we were sure our forces were sufficient to take the city of

ALMA 57:3-16
Antiparah by our force; and by delivering up the prisoners for that city we should suppose ourselves unwise, and that we would only deliver up our prisoners on exchange.
3 And Ammoron refused mine epistle, for he would not exchange prisoners; therefore we began to make preparations to go against the city of Antiparah.
4 But the people of Antiparah did leave the city, and fled to their other cities, which they had possession of, to fortify them; and thus the city of Antiparah fell into our hands.
5 And thus ended the twenty and eighth year of the reign of the judges.
6 And it came to pass that in the *commencement of the twenty and ninth year, we received a supply of provisions, and also an addition to our army, from the land of Zara- hemla, and from the land round about, to the number of six thou- sand men, besides sixty of the “sons of the Ammonites who had come to join their brethren, my little band of two thousand. And now behold, we were strong, yea, and we had also plenty of provisions brought untous.
7 And it came to pass that it was our desire to wage a battle with the army which was placed to protect the city 7?Cumeni.
8 And now behold, I will show unto you that we soon accomplished our desire; yea, with our strong force, or with a part of our strong force, we did surround, by night, the city Cumeni, a little before they were to receive a supply of provisions.
9 And it came to pass that we did camp round about the city for many nights; but we did sleep upon our swords, and keep guards, that the Lamanites could not come upon us by night and slay us, which they attempted many times; but as many times as they attempted this their blood was spilt.
10 At length their provisions did arrive, and they were about to enter
57 6a Alma53: 16. 7a Alma 56: 14.
lla Alma 56:9,
352. ||
the city by night. And we, instead of being Lamanites, were Nephites; therefore, we did take them and — their provisions.
11 And notwithstanding the La- manites being cut off from their sup- port after this manner, they were still determined to maintain the city; therefore it became expedient that we should take those provisions and send them to “Judea, and our prisoners to the land of Zarahemla.
12 And it came to pass that not many days had passed away before the Lamanites began to lose all hopes of succor; therefore they yielded up the city unto our hands; and thus we had accomplished our designs in obtaining the city Cumeni.
13 But it came to pass that our prisoners were so numerous that, notwithstanding the enormity of our numbers, we were obliged to employ all our force to keep them, or to put them to death.
14 For behold, they would break out in great numbers, and would fight with stones, and with clubs, or whatsoever thing they could get into their hands, insomuch that we did slay upwards of two thousand of them after they had surrendered themselves prisoners of war.
15 Therefore it became expedient for us, that we should put an end to their lives, or guard them, sword in hand, down to the land of Zara- hemla; and also our provisions were not any more than sufficient for our own people, notwithstanding that which we had taken from’ the Lamanites.
16 And now, in those critical cir- cumstances, it became a very serious matter to determine con- cerning these prisoners of war; nevertheless, we did resolve to send them down to the land of Zara- hemla; therefore we selected a part of our men, and gave them charge Over our prisoners to go down to the land of Zarahemla.
[*63 B.c.]
353
17 But it came to pass that on the morrow they did return. And now behold, we did not “inquire of them concerning the prisoners ; for behold, the Lamanites were upon us, and they returned in season to save us from falling into their hands. For behold, Ammoron had sent to their support a new supply of provisions and also a numerous army of men.
18 And it came to pass that those men whom we sent with the prison- ers did arrive in season to check them, as they were about to over- power us.
19 But behold, my little band of two thousand and sixty fought most desperately; yea, they were firm before the Lamanites, and did 2administer death unto all those who opposed them.
20 And as the remainder of our army were about to give way before the Lamanites, behold, those two thousand and sixty were firm and undaunted.
21 Yea, and they did “obey and observe to perform every word of command with exactness; yea, and even according to their faith it was done unto them; and I did remem- ber the words which they said unto me that their "mothers had taught them.
22 And now behold, it was these my sons, and those men who had been selected to convey the prison- ers, to whom we owe this. great victory; for it was they who did beat the Lamanites; therefore they were driven back to the city of Manti.
23 And we retained our city Cumeni, and were not all destroyed by the sword; nevertheless, we had suffered great loss.
24 And it came to pass that after the Lamanites had fled, I immedi- ately gave orders that my men who had been wounded should be taken

from among the dead, and caused that their wounds should be dressed.
25 And it came to pass that there were two hundred, out of my two thousand and_ sixty, who had fainted because of the loss of blood; nevertheless, according to the good- ness of God, and to our great astonishment, and also the joy of our whole army, there was “not one soul of them who did perish; yea, and. neither was there one soul among them who had not received many wounds.
26 And now, their “preservation was astonishing to our whole army, yea, that they should be spared while there was a thousand of our brethren who were slain. And we do justly ascribe it to the miraculous *’power of God, because of their exceeding ‘faith in that which they had been taught to believe—that there was a just God, and whoso- ever did not doubt, that they should be. preserved by his marvelous power.
27 Now this was the “faith of these of whom I have spoken; they are young, and their minds are firm. and they do put their trust in God continually.
28 And now it came to pass that after we had thus taken care of our wounded men, and had buried our dead and also the dead of the Lamanites, who were many, behold, we did inquire of Gid concerning the *¢prisoners whom they had started to go down to the land of Zarahemla with.
29 Now Gid was the chief captain over the band who was appointed to guard them down to the land.
30 And now, these are the words which Gid said unto me: Behold, we did start to go down to the land of Zarahemla with our. prisoners. And it came to pass that we did meet the spies of our armies, who

had been sent out to watch the camp of the Lamanites.
31 And they cried unto us, saying— Behold, the armies of the Laman- ites are marching towards the city of Cumeni; and behold, they will fall upon them, yea, and will destroy our people.
32 And it came to pass that our prisoners did hear their cries, which caused them to take courage; and they did rise up in rebellion against us.
33 And it came to pass because of their rebellion we did cause that our swords should come upon them. And it came to pass that they did in a body run upon our swords, in the which, the greater number of them were slain; and the remainder of them broke through and fled from
us.
34 And behold, when they had fled and we could not overtake them, we took our march with speed to- wards the city Cumeni; and behold, we did arrive in time that we might assist our brethren in preserving the city.
35 And behold, we are again delivered out of the hands of our enemies. And blessed is the name of our God; for behold, it is he that has delivered us; yea, that has done this great thing for us.
36 Now it came to pass that when I, Helaman, had heard these words of Gid, I was filled with exceeding joy because of the goodness of God in preserving us, that we might not all perish; yea, and I trust that the souls of them who have been slain pt “entered into the rest of their

AND behold, now it came to pass that our next object was to obtain the city of Manti; but behold, there was no way that we could lead them out of the city by our small bands. For behold, they remembered that which we had hitherto done; there- fore we could not “decoy them away from their strongholds.
2 And they were so much more numerous than was our army that we durst not go forth and attack them in their strongholds.
3 Yea, and it became expedient that we should employ our men to the maintaining those parts of the land which we had regained of our possessions; therefore it became expedient that we should wait, that we might receive more strength from the land of Zarahemla and also a new supply of provisions.
4 And it came to pass that I thus did send an embassy to the governor of our land, to acquaint him con- cerning the affairs of our people. And it came to pass that we did wait to receive provisions and strength from the land of Zarahemla.
5 But behold, this did profit us but little; for the Lamanites were also receiving great strength from day to day, and also many provisions; and thus were our circumstances at this period of time.
6 And the Lamanites were sallying forth against us from time to time, resolving by stratagem to destroy us; nevertheless we could not come to battle with them, because of their “retreats and their strongholds.
7 And it came to pass that we did wait in these difficult circumstances for the space of many months, even until we were about to “perish for the want of food.
8 But it came to pass that we did receive food, which was guarded to us by an army of two thousand men to our assistance; and this is all the assistance which we did receive, to defend ourselves and our country
7a Alma 60: 9.
[About 63 B.c.]
355
from falling into the hands of our enemies, yea, to contend with an enemy which was innumerable.
9 And now the cause of these our embarrassments, or the cause why they did not send more strength unto us, we Knew not; therefore we were grieved and also filled with fear, lest by any means the judg- ments of God should come'upon our land, to our overthrow and utter destruction.
10 Therefore we did pour out our souls in prayer to God, that he would strengthen us and deliver us out of the hands of our enemies, yea, and also give us strength that we might retain our cities, and our lands, and our possessions, for the support of our people.
11 Yea, and it came to pass that the Lord our God did visit us with assurances that he would deliver us; yea, insomuch that he did speak peace to our souls, and did grant unto us great faith, and did cause us that we should hope for our ?deliver- ancein him.
12 And we did take courage with our small force which we had received, and were fixed with a determination to conquer our enemies, and to “maintain our lands, and our possessions, and our wives, and our children, and the cause of our "liberty.
13 And thus we did go forth with all our might against the Lamanites, who were in the city of Manti;-and we did pitch our tents by the wilder- ness side, which was near tothe city.
14 And it. came to pass that on the morrow, that when the Lamanites saw that we were in the borders by the wilderness which was near the city, that they sent out their spies round about us that they might discover the number and the strength of ourarmy.
15 And it came to pass that when they saw. that we were not strong, according to our numbers, and

ALMA 58:9-20
fearing that we should cut them off from their support except they should come out to battle against us and kill us, and also supposing that’ they could easily destroy us with their numerous ‘hosts, therefore they began to make preparations to come out against us to battle.
16 And when we saw that they were making preparations to come out against us, behold, I caused that Gid, with a small number of men, should “secrete himself in’ the wilderness, and also that Teomner and a small number of men should secrete themselves also in’ the wilderness.
17 Now Gid and his men were on the right and the others on the left; and when they had thus secreted themselves, behold, I~ remained, with the remainder of my army, in that same place where we had first pitched our tents against the time that the Lamanites should come out to battle.
18 And it came to pass that the Lamanites did come out with their numerous army against us. And when they had come and were about to fall upon us with the sword, I caused that my men, those who were with me, should retreat into’ the wilderness.
19 And it came to pass that the Lamanites did follow after us with great speed, for they were exceed- ingly desirous to overtake us that they might slay us; therefore they did follow us into the wilderness; and we did pass by in the midst of Gid and Teomner,' insomuch that they were not discovered by the Lamanites.
20 And it came to pass that when the Lamanites had passed by, or when the army had passed by, Gid and Teomner did rise up from their secret places, and did cut off the spies’ of the Lamanites that they should not return to the city.
52:21 (21-31).
[About 63 B.c.]
ALMA 58:21—37
21 And it came to pass that when they had cut them off, they ran to the city and fell upon the guards who were left to guard the city, insomuch that they did destroy them and did take possession of the city.
22 Now this was done because the Lamanites did suffer their whole army, save a few guards only, to be led away into the wilderness.
23 And it came to pass that Gid and Teomner by this means had obtained possession of their strong- holds. And it came to pass that we took our course, after having traveled much in the wilderness towards the land of Zarahemla.
24 And when the Lamanites saw that they were marching towards the land of Zarahemla, they were exceedingly afraid, lest there was a plan laid to lead them on to destruc- tion; therefore they began to retreat into the wilderness again, yea, even back by the same way which they had come.
25 And behold, it was night and they did pitch their tents, for the chief “captains of the Lamanites had supposed that the Nephites were weary because of their march; and supposing that they had driven their whole army therefore they took no thought concerning the city of Manti.
26. Now it came to pass that when it was night, I caused that my men should not sleep, but that they should march forward by another way towards the land of Manti.
27 And because of this our march in. the night-time, behold, on the morrow we were beyond the La- manites, insomuch that wedid arrive before them at the city of Manti.
28 And thus it came to pass, that by this stratagem we did take possession of the city of Manti without the shedding of blood.
29 And it came to pass that when

356
the armies of the Lamanites did arrive near the city, and saw that we were prepared to meet them, they were astonished exceedingly and struck with great fear, inso- much that they did “flee into the wilderness.
30 Yea, and it came to pass that the armies of the Lamanites did flee out of all this quarter of the land. But behold, they have carried with them many women and children out of the land.
31 And “those cities which had been taken by the Lamanites, all of them are at this period of time in our possession; and our fathers and our women and our children are returning to their homes, all save it be those who have been taken prisoners and carried off by the Lamanites.
32 But behold, our armies are small to maintain so great a number of cities and so great possessions.
33 But behold, we “trust in our God who has given us victory over those lands, insomuch that we have obtained those cities and those lands, which were our own.
34 Now we do not know the “cause that the government does not grant us more strength; neither do those men who came up unto us know why we have not received greater strength.
35 Behold, we do not know but what “ye are unsuccessful, and ye have drawn away the forces into that quarter of the land; if so, we do not desire tomurmutr.
36 And if it is not so, behold, we fear that there is some “faction in the government, that they do not send more men to. our assistance; for we know that they are more numerous than that which they have sent,
37 But, behold, it mattereth not— we trust God will ¢deliver us, not- withstanding the weakness of our

armies, yea, and deliver us out of the hands of our enemies.
38 Behold, this is the twenty and ninth year, in the latter end, and we are in the possession of our lands; and the Lamanites have fled to the land of Nephi. .
39 And those sons of the people of Ammon, of whom I have so highly spoken, are with me in the city of Manti; and the Lord has supported them, yea, and kept them from falling by the sword, insomuch that even “one soul has not been slain.
40 But behold, they have received many wounds; nevertheless they *stand fast in that "liberty where- with God has made them free; and they are strict to remember the Lord their God from.day to day; yea, they do observe to keep his statutes, and his judgments, and his commandments. continually; and their faith is strong in the prophecies concerning that which is to come.
41 And now, my beloved brother, Moroni, may the Lord our God, who has redeemed us and made us free, keep you continually in his pres- ence; yea, and may he favor this people, even that ye may have suc- cess in obtaining the possession of all that which the Lamanites have taken from us, which was for our support. And now, behold, I close mine epistle. I am Helaman, the son of Alma.

ingly rejoiced because of the welfare, yea, the exceeding success which Helaman had had, in obtaining >those lands which were lost.
2 Yea, and he did make it known unto.all his people, in all the land round about in that part where he was, that they might rejoice also.
3 And it came to pass that he im- mediately sent “an epistle to "Pahor- an, desiring that he should cause men to be gathered together to strengthen Helaman, or the armies of Helaman, insomuch that he might with ease maintain that part of the land which he had been so miraculously prospered in regaining.
4 And it came to pass when Moroni had sent this epistle to the land of Zarahemla, he began again to lay a plan that he might obtain the remainder of those possessions and cities which the Lamanites had taken from them.
5 And it came to pass that while Moroni was thus making prepara- tions to go against the Lamanites to battle, behold, the people of *Nephi- hah, who were gathered together from the city of Moroni and the city of Lehi and the city of Morianton, were attacked by the Lamanites.
6 Yea, even those who. had been *compelled to flee from the land of Manti, and from the land round about, had come over and joined the Lamanites in this part of the land.
7 And thus being exceedingly numerous, yea, and _ receiving strength from day to day, by the command of Ammoron they came forth against the people of Ne- phihah, and they did begin to slay them with an exceedingly great slaughter.
8 And their armies were so numer- ous that the remainder of: the people of *Nephihah were °obliged to flee before them; and they came even and joined the army of Moroni.

9 And now as Moroni had sup- posed that there “should be men sent to the city of Nephihah, to the assistance of the people to maintain that city, and knowing that it was easier to keep the city from falling into. the hands of the Lamanites than to retake it from them, he sup- posed that they would easily main- tain that city.
10. Therefore he retained all his force to maintain those places which he had recovered.
11 And now,.when Moroni saw that the city of Nephihah was “lost he was. exceedingly sorrowful, and began to doubt, because of. the wickedness of the people, whether they should not fall into the hands of their brethren.
12 Now this was the case with all his chief captains. They doubted and marveled also because of the wickedness of the people, and this because of the success of the Lamanites over them.
13 And it came to pass that: Moroni was angry with the government, because of their “indifference con- cerning the freedom of _ their country.
CHAPTER 60
Moroni complains to Pahoran of the government’s neglect of the armies— The Lord suffers the righteous to be slain—The Nephites must use all of their power and means to deliver themselves from their enemies— Moroni threatens to fight against the government unless help is supplied to his armies.
AND it came to pass that he wrote “again to the governor of the land, who was Pahoran, and these are the words. which he wrote, saying: Behold, I direct mine epistle to Pahoran, in the city of Zarahemla, who is the chief judge and the *sovernor over the land, and also to

all those who have been chosen by this people to govern and manage the affairs of this war.
2 For behold, I have somewhat to say unto them by the way of “condemnation; for behold, ye your- selves know that ye have been appointed to gather together men, and arm them with swords, and with cimeters, and all manner of weap- ons of war of every kind, and send forth against the Lamanites, in whatsoever parts they should come into our land.
3 And now behold, I-say unto you that myself, and also my men, and also Helaman and his men, have suffered exceedingly great “suffer- ings; yea, even hunger, thirst, and fatigue, and all manner of afflictions of every kind.
4 But behold, were this all we had suffered we would not murmur nor complain.
5 But behold, great has been the slaughter among our people; yea, thousands have fallen by the sword, while it might have otherwise been if ye had rendered unto our armies sufficient strength and succor for them. Yea, great has been your neglect towards us.
6 And now behold, we desire to know the cause of this exceedingly great neglect; yea, we desire to know the cause of your thoughtless state.
7 Can you think to sit upon your thrones in a state of thoughtless “stupor, while your enemies are spreading the work of death around you? Yea, while they are murder- ing thousands of your brethren—
8 Yea, even they who have looked up to you for protection, yea, have placed you in a situation that ye might have succored them, yea, ye might have sent armies unto them, to have strengthened them, and have saved thousands of them from falling by the sword.

9 But behold, this is not all—ye have withheld your provisions from them, insomuch that many have fought and bled out their lives because of their gréat desires which they had for the welfare of. this people; yea, and this they have done when they were about to “perish with hunger, because of your exceed- ingly great neglect towards them.
10 And now, my beloved breth- ren—for ye ought to be beloved; yea, and ye ought to have stirred yourselves more diligently for the welfare and the freedom of this people; but behold, ye have ne- glected them insomuch that. the blood of thousands shall come upon your heads for vengeance; yea, for "known unto God were all their cries, and all their sufferings—
11 Behold, could ye suppose that ye could sit upon your thrones, and because of the exceeding goodness of God ye could do nothing and he would deliver you? Behold, if ye have supposed this ye have sup- posed in vain.
12 Do ye “suppose that, because so many of your brethren have been killed it is because of their wicked- ness? I say unto you, if ye have sup- posed this ye have supposed in vain; for I say unto you, there are many who have fallen by the sword; and behold it is to your condemnation;
13 For the. Lord suffereth the “righteous to be slain that his justice and "judgment may come upon the wicked; therefore ye need. not sup- pose that the righteous are lost because they are slain; but behold, they do enter into the rest of the Lord their God.
14 And now behold, I say unto you, I fear exceedingly that the judgments of God will come upon this people, because of their exceed- ing “slothfulness, yea, even the

slothfulness of our government, and their exceedingly great neglect to- wards their brethren, yea, towards those who have been slain.
15 For were it not for the wicked- ness which first commenced at our head, we “could have withstood our enemies that they could have gained no power over us.
16 Yea, had it not been for the war which broke out “among ourselves; yea, were it not for these ’king-men, who caused so much bloodshed among ourselves; yea, at the time we were contending among our- selves, if we had united our strength as we hitherto have done; yea, had it not been for the desire of power and authority which those king-men had over us; had they been true to the cause of our freedom, and united with us, and gone forth against our enemies, instead of taking up their swords against us, which was the cause of so much bloodshed among ourselves; yea, if we had gone forth against them in the strength of the Lord, we should have dispersed our enemies, for it would have been done, according to the ‘fulfilling of his word.
17 But behold, now the: Lamanites are coming upon us, taking “pos- session. of our lands, and they are murdering our people with the sword, yea, our women and our children, and also carrying them away captive, causing them that they should suffer all manner of afflictions, and this because of the great wickedness of those who are seeking for power and authority, yea, even those king-men.
18 But why should I say much con- cerning this matter? For we know not but what ye yourselves are seeking for authority. We know not but what ye are also “traitors to your country.

19 Or isit that ye have neglected us because ye are in the heart of our country and ye are “surrounded by security, that ye do not cause food to be sent unto us, and also men to strengthen our armies?
20 Have ye forgotten the com- mandments of the Lord your God? Yea, have ye forgotten the captivity of our fathers? Have ye forgotten the many times we have been delivered out of the hands of our enemies?
21 Or do ye suppose that the Lord “will still deliver us, while we sit upon our thrones and do not make use of the means which the Lord has provided for us?
22 Yea, will ye sit in idleness while ye are surrounded with thousands of those, yea, and tens of thousands, who do also sit in idleness, while there are thousands round about in the borders of the land who are fall- ing by the sword, yea, wounded and bleeding?
23 Do ye suppose that God will look upon you as guiltless while ye sit still and behold these things? Behold I say unto you, Nay. Now I would that ye should remember that God has said that the “inward vessel shall be ’cleansed first, and then shall the outer vessel be cleansed also.
24 And now, except ye do repent of that which ye have done, and begin to be up and doing, and send forth food and men unto us, and also unto Helaman, that he may support those parts of our country which he has regained, and that we may also recover the remainder of our posses- sions in these parts, behold it will be expedient that we contend no more with the Lamanites until we have first cleansed our inward vessel, yea, even the great head of our government.
25 And except ye grant mine epistle, and come out and show unto
360
me a true “spirit of freedom, and strive to strengthen and fortify our armies, and grant unto them food for their support, behold I will leave a part of my freemen to maintain this part of our land, and I will leave the strength and the blessings of God upon them, that none other power can operate against them—
26 And this because of their exceed- ing faith, and their patience in their *tribulations—
27 And I will come unto you, and if there be any among you that has a desire for freedom, yea, if there be even a spark of freedom remaining, behold I will stir up insurrections among you, even until those who have desires to usurp power and authority shall become extinct.
28 Yea, behold I do not fear your power nor your authority, but it is my *God whom I fear; and it is according to his commandments that I do take my sword to defend the cause of my country, and it is because of your iniquity that we have suffered so much loss.
29 Behold it is time, yea, the time is now at hand, that except ye do bestir yourselves in the defence of your country and your little ones, the “sword of justice doth hang over you; yea, and it shall fall upon you and visit you even to your utter destruction.
30 Behold, I wait for assistance from you; and, except ye do ad- minister unto our relief, behold, I come unto you, even in the land of Zarahemla, and smite you with the sword, insomuch that ye can have no more power to impede the prog- ress of this people in the cause of our freedom.
31 For behold, the Lord will not suffer that ye shall live and wax strong in your iniquities to destroy his righteous people.

33 Ye know that ye do transgress the laws of God, and ye do know that ye do trample them under your feet. Behold, the Lord saith unto me: If those whom ye have ap- pointed your governors. do not repent of their sins and “iniquities, ye shall "go up to battle against them.
34 And now behold, I, Moroni, am constrained, according to the cove- nant which I have made to keep the commandments of my God; there- fore I would that ye should adhere to the word of God, and send speed- ily unto me of your provisions and of your men, and also to Helaman,
35 And behold, if ye will not do this I come unto you speedily ; for behold, God will not suffer that we should perish with hunger; there- fore he will give unto us of your food, even if it must be by the sword. Now see that ye fulfil the word of God.
36 Behold, I am Moroni, your chief captain. I “seek not for power, but to pull it down. I °seek not for honor of the world, but for the glory of my God, and the freedom and welfare of my country. And thus I close mine epistle.

BEHOLD, now it came to pass that soon after Moroni had sent his epistle unto the chief governor, he received an epistle from *Pahoran, the chief governor. And these are the words which he received:
2 I, Pahoran, who am the chief governor of this land, do send these words unto Moroni, the chief captain over the army. Behold, I say unto you, Moroni, that I do not joy in your great “afflictions, yea, it grieves my soul.
3 But behold, there are those who do joy in your afflictions, yea, in- somuch that they have risen up in “rebellion against me, and also those of my people who are "freemen, yea, and those who have risen up are exceedingly numerous.
4 And it is those who have sought to take away the judgment-seat from me that have been the cause of this great iniquity; for they have used great “flattery, and they have ‘led away the hearts of many people, which will be the cause of sore affliction among us; they have withheld our provisions, and have daunted our ‘freemen that they have not come unto you.
5 And behold, they have driven me out before them, and I have fled to theland of Gideon, withasmany men as it were possible that I could get.
6 And behold, I have sent a pro- clamation throughout this part of the land; and behold, they are “flocking to us °daily, to their arms, in the defence of their country and their ‘freedom, and to avenge our dwrongs.
7 And they have come unto us, insomuch that those who have risen up in rebellion against us are set at defiance, yea, insomuch that they do fear us and durst not come out against us to battle.

8 They have “got possession of the land, or the city, of Zarahemla; they have appointed a ’king over them, and he hath written unto the king of the Lamanites, in the which he hath joined an alliance with him; in the which alliance he hath agreed to maintain the city of Zarahemla, which maintenance he supposeth will enable the Lamanites to con- quer the remainder of the land, and he shall be placed king over this people when they shall be conquered ‘under the Lamanites.
9 And now, in your epistle you have “censured me, but it mattereth not; Iam not angry, but do rejoice in the greatness of your heart. I, Pahoran, do not seek for power, save only to retain my judgment- seat that I may preserve the rights and the liberty of my people. My soul standeth fast in that liberty in the which God hath made us “free.
10 And now, behold, we will resist wickedness even unto bloodshed. We would “not shed the blood of the Lamanites if they would stay in their own land.
11 We would not shed the blood of our brethren if they would not rise up in rebellion and take the sword against us.
12 We would subject ourselves to the “yoke of bondage if it were requisite with the justice of God, or if he should command us so to do.
13 But behold he doth not com- mand us that we shall subject our- selves to our enemies, but that we should put our “trust in him, and he will deliver us.
14 Therefore, my beloved brother, Moroni, let us resist evil, and what- soever evil we cannot resist with our “words, yea, such as rebellions and dissensions, let us "resist them
362
with our swords, that we may retain our freedom, that we may rejoice in the great privilege of our church, and in the cause of our Redeemer and our God.
15 Therefore, come unto me speedily with a few of your men, and leave the remainder in the charge of Lehi and Teancum; give unto them power to conduct the *war in that part of the land, according to the °Spirit of God, which is also the ‘spirit of freedom which is in them. |
16 Behold I have sent a few pro- visions unto them, that they may not perish until ye can come unto me.
17 Gather together whatsoever force ye can upon your march hither, and we will go speedily against those dissenters, in the strength of our God according to the faith which is in us.
18 And we will “take possession of the city of Zarahemla, that we may obtain more food to send forth unto Lehi and Teancum; yea, we will go forth against them in the strength of the Lord, and we will put an end to this great iniquity.
19 And now, Moroni, I do joy in receiving your epistle, for I was somewhat worried concerning what we should do, whether it should be just in us to go against our brethren.
20 But ye have said, except they repent the Lord “hath commanded you that ye should go against them.
21 See that ye “strengthen Lehi and Teancum in the Lord; tell them to fear not, for God will deliver them, yea, and also all those who stand fast in that liberty wherewith God hath made them free. And now I close mine epistle to my beloved brother, Moroni.

CHAPTER 62
Moroni marches to the aid of Pahoran in the land of Gideon—The king-men who refuse to defend their country are put to death—Pahoran and Moroni retake Nephihah—Many Lamanites join the people of Ammon—Teancum slays Ammoron and is in turn slain— The Lamanites are driven from the land, ‘and peace is established— Helaman returns to the ministry and builds up the Church.
AND now it came to pass that when Moroni had received this epistle his heart did take courage, and was filled with exceedingly great joy because of the faithfulness of Pahoran, that he was not also a “traitor to the freedom and cause of his country.
2 But he did also mourn exceed- ingly because of the iniquity of those who had driven Pahoran from the judgment-seat, yea, in fine because of those who had: rebelled against their country and also their God.
3 And it came to pass that Moroni took a small number of men, according to the desire of Pahoran, and. gave Lehi and Teancum com- mand over the remainder of his army, and took his march towards the land of Gideon.
4 And he did raise the “standard of ‘liberty in whatsoever place he did enter, and gained whatsoever force he could in all his march towards the land of Gideon.
5 And it came to pass that thou- sands did “flock unto his standard, and did take up their swords in the defence of their freedom, that they might not come into bondage.
6 And thus, when Moroni had gathered together whatsoever men he could in all his march, he came to the land of Gideon; and uniting his forces with those of Pahoran they became exceedingly strong, even stronger than the men of Pachus,

who was the “king of those dissenters who had driven the freemen out of the land of Zarahemla and had taken possession of the land.
7 And it came to pass that Moroni and Pahoran went down with their armies into the land of Zarahemla, and went forth against the city, and did meet the men of Pachus, insomuch that they did come ‘to battle.
8 And behold, Pachus was slain and his men were taken prisoners, and Pahoran was restored to his judgment-seat.
9 And the men of Pachus received their trial, according to the law, and also those king-men who had been taken and “cast into prison; and they were "executed according to the law; yea, those men of Pachus and those ‘king-men, whosoever would not take up arms in the defence of their country, but would fight against it, were put to death.
10 And thus it became expedient that this law should be strictly observed for the safety of their country; yea, and whosoever was found denying their freedom was speedily “executed according to the law.
11 And thus ended the thirtieth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi; Moroni and Pahoran having restored peace to the land of Zarahemla, among their own people, having “inflicted death upon all those who were not true to the cause of freedom.
12 And it came to pass in the *commencement of the thirty and first year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi, Moroni immediately caused that provisions should be sent, and also an army of six thousand men should be sent unto Helaman, to assist him in preserving that part of the land.
13 And he also caused that an

ALMA 62:14-29
army. of six thousand men, with a sufficient quantity of food, should be sent to the armies of Lehi and Teancum. And it came to pass that this was done to fortify the land against the Lamanites.
14 And it came to pass that Moroni and Pahoran, leaving a large body of men in the land of Zarahemla, took their march with a large body of men towards the land of Nephi- hah, being determined to “over- throw the Lamanites in that city.
15 And it came to pass that as they were marching towards the land, they took a large body of men of the Lamanites, and slew many of them, and took their provisions and their weapons of war.
16 And it came to pass after they had taken them, they caused them to enter into a “covenant that they would nomore take up their weapons of war against the Nephites.
17 And when they had entered into this covenant they sent them to 2dwell with the people of Ammon, and they were in number about four thousand who had not been slain.
18 And it came to pass that when they had sent them away they pursued their march towards the land of “Nephihah. And it came to pass that when they had come to the city of Nephihah, they did pitch their tents in the plains of Nephihah, which is near the city of Nephihah.
19 Now Moroni was desirous that the Lamanites should come out to battle against them, upon the plains; but the Lamanites, knowing of their exceedingly great courage, and beholding the greatness of their numbers, therefore they durst not come out against them; there- fore they did not come to battle in that day.
20 And when the night came, Moroni went forth in the darkness of the night, and came upon the top of the wall to spy out in what part of

the city the Lamanites did camp with their army.
21 And it came to pass that they were on the east, by the entrance; and they were all asleep. And now Moroni returned to his army, and | caused that they should prepare in | haste strong cords and ladders, to be let down from the top of the ?wall into the inner part of the wall.
22 And it came to pass that Moroni caused that his men should march forth and come upon the top of the wall, and let “themselves down into that part of the city, yea, even on the west, where the Lamanites did not camp with their armies.
23 And it came to pass that they were all let down into the city by night, by the means of their strong cords and their ladders; thus when the morning came they were all within the walls of the city.
24 And now, when the Lamanites awoke and saw that the armies of Moroni were within the walls, they were affrighted exceedingly, inso- much that they did flee out by the pass.
25 And now when Moroni saw that they were fleeing before him, he did cause that his men should march forth against them, and slew many, and surrounded many others, and took them prisoners; and the remainder of them fled into the land of Moroni, which was in the borders by the seashore.
26 Thus had Moroni and Pahoran obtained the “possession of the city of Nephihah without the loss of one soul; and there were many of the Lamanites who were slain.
27 Now it came to pass that many of the Lamanites that were prisoners were desirous to “join the people of Ammon and become a free people.
28 Andit came to pass that as many as were desirous, unto them it was granted according to their desires. 29 Therefore, all the prisoners of
26a Alma 59: 8. 27a Alma 24; 26 (25-27).
[About 61 B.c.]
365
the Lamanites did join the people of Ammon, and did begin to labor exceedingly, tilling. the ground, raising all manner.of. grain, and flocks and herds of every kind; and thus were the Nephites relieved from a great burden; yea, insomuch that they were relieved from all the prisoners of the Lamanites.
30 Nowit cameto pass that Moroni, after he had obtained. possession of the city of Nephihah, having taken many prisoners, which did reduce the armies of the Lamanites exceed- ingly, and having regained many of the Nephites who had been taken prisoners, which did strengthen the army of Moroni exceedingly; there- fore Moroni went forth from the land of Nephihah to the land of *Lehi.
31 And it came to pass that when the Lamanites saw that Moroni was coming against them, they were again frightened-and fled before the army of Moroni.
32 Andit came to pass that “Moroni and his army did pursue them from city to city, until they were met by Lehi and Teancum; and the Laman- ites fled from Lehi and Teancum, even down upon. the borders: by the seashore, until they came to the land of Moroni.
33 And the armies of the Lamanites were all gathered together, inso- much that they were all in one body in. the land of Moroni. Now. Am- moron, the king of the Lamanites, was also with them.
34 And it came to pass that Moroni and Lehi and Teancum did encamp with their armies round about in the borders of the:land of Moroni, in- somuch that the Lamanites were encircled about in the borders by the wilderness on the south, and in the borders by the wilderness on the east.
35 And thus they. did encamp for the night. For behold, the Nephites and the Lamanites also were weary

because of the greatness: of the march; therefore they did not re- solve upon any stratagem>in the night-time, save it were Teancum; for he was exceedingly angry with Ammoron, insomuch that he con- sidered that Ammoron, and Ama- lickiah his brother, had been the “cause of this great and lasting war between them and the Lamanites, which had been the cause of so much war and bloodshed, yea, and so much famine.
36 And it came to pass that Tean- cum in his anger did go forth into the camp of the Lamanites, and did let himself down over the walls of the city. And he went forth with a cord, from place to place, insomuch that he-did find the king; and he did cast a javelin at him, which did pierce him near the heart. But be- hold,- the: king did» awaken. his servants before he died, insomuch that they did pursue Teancum, and slew him.
37 Now it came to pass that when Lehi and Moroni knew that Tean- cum was dead they were exceedingly sorrowful; for behold, he had been aman who had “fought valiantly for his country, yea, a true friend to liberty; and he had suffered very many exceedingly sore afflictions. But behold, he was dead, and had gone the way of all the earth.
38 Now it came to pass that Moroni marched forth on the morrow, and came upon the Lamanites, insomuch that they did slay them with a great slaughter; and they did drive them out of the land; and they did flee, even that they did not return at that time against the Nephites.
39 And thus *ended the thirty and first year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi; and thus they had had wars, and bloodsheds, and famine, and affliction, for the space of many years.
40 And there had been murders,
wars, Alma 50: 35; 51: 29-34; 52; 61; 62: 3-37.
[*60 B.c.]
ALMA 62:41-52
and contentions, and dissensions, and all manner of iniquity among the people of Nephi; nevertheless for the“righteous’ sake, yea, because of the prayers of the righteous, they were spared.
41 But behold, because of the exceedingly great length of the war between the —Nephites and the Lamanites many had become hard- ened, because of the exceedingly great length of the war; and many were softened because of their ‘afflictions, insomuch that they did humble themselves before God, even in the depth of humility.
42 And it came to pass that after Moroni had fortified those parts of the land which were most exposed to the Lamanites, until they were sufficiently strong, he returned to the city of Zarahemla; and also Helaman returned to the place of his inheritance; and there was once more peace established among the people of Nephi.
43 And Moroni yielded up the *command of his armies into the hands of his son, whose name was *Moronihah; and he retired to his own house that he might spend the remainder of his days in peace.
44 And Pahoran did return to his judgment-seat; and Helaman did take upon him again to preach unto the people the word of God; for because of so many wars and con- tentions it had become expedient that a “regulation should be made again in the church.
45 Therefore, Helaman and his brethren went forth, and did declare the word of God with much power unto the “convincing of many people of their wickedness, which did cause them to repent of their sins and to bes eh oR unto the Lord their
od.

46 And it came to pass that they did establish again the church of God, throughout all the land.
47 Yea, and regulations were made concerning the law. And _ their “judges, and their chief judges were | chosen. \|
48 And the people of Nephi began to “prosper again in the land, and began to multiply and to wax exceedingly strong again in the land. And they began to grow exceedingly rich.
49 But notwithstanding their riches, or their strength, or their prosperity, they were not lifted up in the pride of their eyes; neither were they “slow to remember the Lord their God ; but they did humble themselves exceedingly before him.
50 Yea, they did remember how great things the Lord had done for them, that he had “delivered them from death, and from bonds, and from prisons, and from all manner of afflictions, and he had ‘delivered them out of the hands of. their enemies.
51 And they did pray unto the Lord their God -continually, insomuch that the Lord did bless them, accord- ing to his word, so that they did wax strong and “prosper in the land.
52 And it came to pass that all these things were done. And “Hela- man died, in the *thirty and fifth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.

AND it came to pass in the *com- mencement of the thirty and sixth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi, that “Shiblon took possession of those °sacred things which had been delivered un- to Helaman by Alma.
2 And he was a just man, and he did walk uprightly before God; and he did observe to do good continu- ally, to keep the commandments of the Lord his God; and also did his brother.
3 And it came to pass that “Moroni died also. And thus ended the thirty and sixth year of the reign of the judges.
4 And it came to pass that in the fthirty and seventh year of the reign of the judges, there was a large company. of men, even to the amount of five thousand and four hundred men, with their wives and their children, departed out of the land of Zarahemla into the land which was “northward.
5 And it came to pass that Hagoth, he being an ’exceedingly curious man, therefore he went forth and built him an exceedingly large ship, on the borders of the land "Bountiful, by the land Desolation, and launch- ed it forth into the west sea, by the ‘narrow neck which led into the land northward.
6 And behold, there were many of the Nephites who did enter therein and did sail forth with much pro- visions, and also many women and children; and they took their course northward. And thus ended the thirty and seventh year.
7 And in the thirty and eighth year, this man built “other ships. And the first ship did also return, and many more people did enter

ALMA 63:1-14
into it; and they also took much provisions, and set out again to the
- land northward.
8 And it came to pass that they were never heard of more. And we suppose that they were drowned in the depths of the sea. And it came to pass that one other ship also did sail forth; and whither she did go we know not.
9 And it came to pass that in this year there were many people who went forth into the land “north- ward. And thus ended the thirty and eighth year.
10 And it came to pass in the thirty and ninth year of the reign of the judges, *Shiblon died also, and Corianton had gone forth to the land northward in a ship, to carry forth provisions unto the people who had gone forth into that land.
11 Therefore it became expedient for *Shiblon to confer those sacred things, before his death, upon the son of ’Helaman, who was called ‘Helaman, being called after the name of his father.
12 Now behold, all those “engrav- ings which were in the possession of Helaman were written and_ sent forth among the children of men throughout all the land, save it were those parts which had been com- manded by Alma should °not go forth.
13 Nevertheless, these things were to be kept sacred, and “handed down from one generation to an- other; therefore, in this year, they had been conferred upon Helaman, before the death of Shiblon.
14 And it came to pass also in this year that there were some dissenters who had gone forth unto the

and driven back again to their own lands, suffering great loss.
16 And thus ended the thirty and ninth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.

Pahoran the second becomes chief
judge and is murdered by Kishkumen —Pacumeni fills the judgment-seat— Coriantumr leads the Lamanite armies, takes Zarahemla, and slays Pacumeni—Moronihah defeats the Lamanites and retakes Zarahemla, and Coriantumr is slain.
ND now behold, it came to pass in the *commencement of the fortieth year of the
reignof the judges over the people of Nephi, there began to be a serious difficulty among the people of the Nephites.
2 For behold, *Pahoran had died, and gone the way of all the earth; therefore there began to be a serious contention concerning who should have the judgment-seat among the brethren, who were the sons of Pahoran.

3 Now these are their names who did contend for the judgment-seat, who did also cause the people to contend: Pahoran, Paanchi, and Pacumeni.
4 Now these are not all the sons of Pahoran (for he had many), but these are they who did contend for the judgment-seat; therefore, they did cause three “divisions among the people.
5 Nevertheless, it came to pass that Pahoran was appointed by the *voice of the people to be chief judge and a governor over the people of Nephi.
6 And it came to pass that Pacu- meni, when he saw that he could not obtain the judgment-seat, he did “unite with the voice of the people.
7 But behold, Paanchi, and that part of the people that were desirous that he should be their governor, was exceedingly wroth; therefore,

[*52 B.c.]

he was about to “flatter away those people to rise up in rebellion against their brethren.
8 And it came to pass as he was about to do this, behold, he was taken, and was tried according to the “voice of the people, and con- demned unto death; for he had raised up in rebellion and sought to destroy the “liberty of the people.
9 Now when those people who were desirous that he should be their governorsaw that he was condemned unto death, therefore they were angry, and behold, they sent forth one “Kishkumen, even to the judg- ment-seat of Pahoran, and mur- dered Pahoran as he sat upon the judgment-seat.
10 And he was pursued by the servants of Pahoran; but behold, so speedy was the flight of Kishkumen that no man could overtake him.
11 And he went unto those: that sent him, and they all entered intoa covenant, yea, “swearing by their everlasting Maker, that they would tell no man that Kishkumen had murdered Pahoran.
12 Therefore, Kishkumen was not known among the people of Nephi, for he was in disguise at the time that he murdered Pahoran. And Kishkumen and his band, who had covenanted with him, did mingle themselves among the people, in a manner that they all could not be found; but as many as were found were condemned unto “death.
13 And now behold, Pacumeni was appointed, according to the “voice of the people, to be a chief judge and a governor over the people, to reign in the stead of his brother Pahoran; and it was according to his right. And all this was done in the fortieth year of the reign of the judges; and it had an end.
14 And it came to pass in the *forty

and first year of the reign of the judges, that the Lamanites had gathered together an innumerable army of men, and “armed them with swords, and with cimeters and with bows, and with arrows, and with head-plates, and with breastplates, and with all manner of shields of every kind.
15 And they came down again that they might pitch battle against the Nephites. And they were led by a man whose name was “Coriantumr; and he was a descendant of Zara- hemla; and he was a "dissenter from among the Nephites; and he was a large and a mighty man.
16 Therefore, the king of the Lamanites, whose name was Tuba- loth, who was the son of 7Ammoron, supposing that Coriantumr, being a mighty man, could stand against the Nephites, with his strength and also with his great “wisdom, inso- much that by sending him forth he should gain power over the Ne- phites—
17 Therefore he did “stir them up to anger, and he did gather together his armies, and he did appoint Coriantumr to be their leader, and did cause that they should march down to the land of Zarahemla to battle against the Nephites.
18 And it came to pass that because of so much contention and so much difficulty in the government, that they had not kept sufficient guards in the land of Zarahemla; for they had supposed that the Lamanites durst not come into the heart of their lands to attack that great city Zarahemla.
19 But it came to pass that Coriantumr did march forth at the head of his numerous host, and came upon the inhabitants of the city, and their march was with such exceedingly great speed that there

[*51 B.c.]
HELAMAN 1:20-32
was no time for the Nephites to gather together their armies.
20 Therefore Coriantumr did cut down the watch by the entrance of the city, and did march forth with his whole army into the city, and they did slay every one who did oppose them, insomuch that they did take possession of the whole city.
21 And it came to pass that Pacu- meni, who was the chief judge, did flee before Coriantumr, even to the walls of the city. And it came to pass that Coriantumr did smite him against the wall, insomuch that he died. And thus ended the days of Pacumeni.
22 And now when Coriantumr saw that he was in possession of the city of Zarahemla, and saw that the Nephites had fled before them, and were slain, and were taken, and were cast into prison, and that he had obtained the possession of the strongest hold in all the land, his heart “took courage insomuch that he was about to go forth against all the land.
23 And now he did not tarry in the land of Zarahemla, but he did march forth with a large army, even to- wards the city of “Bountiful; for it was his determination to go forth and cut his way through with the sword, that he might obtain the north parts of the land.
24 And, supposing that their greatest strength was in the center of the land, therefore he did. march forth, giving them no time to assemble themselves together save it were in small bodies; and in this manner they did fall upon them and cut them down to the earth.
25 But behold, this march of Coriantumr through the center of the land gave Moronihah great advantage over them, notwith- standing the greatness of the num- ber of the Nephites who were slain. 26 For behold, Moronihah had

supposed that the Lamanites durst not come into the center of the land, but that they would attack the cities round about in the borders as they had . hitherto done; therefore Moronihah had caused that their strong armies should maintain those parts round about by the borders.
27 But behold, the Lamanites were not frightened according to his desire, but they had come into the center of the land, and had taken the capital city which was the city of Zarahemla, and were marching through the most capital parts of the land, slaying the people witha great slaughter, both men, women, and children, taking possession of many cities and of many strong- holds.
28 But when Moronihah had dis- covered this, he immediately sent forth Lehi with an army round about to “head them before they should come to the land Bountiful.
29 And thus he did; and he did head them before they came to the land Bountiful, and gave unto them battle, insomuch that they began to retreat back towards the land of Zarahemla.
30 And it came. to pass that Moronihah did head them in their retreat, and did give unto them battle, insomuch that it became an exceedingly bloody battle; yea, many were slain, and among the number who were slain *Coriantumr was also found.
31 And now, behold, the Lamanites could not retreat either way, neither on the north, nor on the south, nor on the east, nor on the west, for they were surrounded on every hand by the Nephites.
32 And thus had Coriantumr plunged the Lamanites into the midst of the Nephites, insomuch that they were in the power of the Nephites, and he himself was slain, and the Lamanites did “yield them- selves into the hands of the Nephites.

33 And it came to pass that Moroni- hah took possession of the city of Zarahemla again, and caused that the Lamanites who had been taken prisoners should depart out of the land in “peace.
34 And thus ended the forty and first year of the reign of the judges.
CHAPTER2
Helaman the second becomes chief judge—Gadianton leads the band of Kishkumen — Helaman’s _ servant slays. Kishkumen, and the Gadianton band flees into the wilderness.
AND it came to pass in the *forty and second year of the reign of the judges, after Moronihah had estab- lished again peace between the Nephites and the Lamanites, behold there was no one to fill the judgment- seat; therefore there began to be a contention again among the people concerning who should fill the judgment-seat.
2 And it came to pass that *Hela- man, who was the son of Helaman, was appointed to fill the judgment- seat, by the °voice of the people.
3 But behold, *Kishkumen, who had murdered Pahoran, did lay wait to destroy Helaman also; and he was upheld by his band, who had entered into a covenant that no one should know his wickedness.
4 For there was one “Gadianton, who was exceedingly expert in many words, and also in his craft, to carry on the secret work of murder and of robbery; therefore he became the leader of the band of Kishkumen.
5 Therefore he did “flatter them, and also Kishkumen, that if they would place him in the judgment- seat he would grant unto those who belonged to his band that they should be placed in power and authority among the people; there-
fore Kishkumen sought to destroy Helaman.
6 And it came to pass as he went forth towards the judgment-seat to destroy Helaman, behold one of the servants of Helaman, having been out by night, and having obtained, through disguise, a knowledge of those plans which had been laid by this band to destroy Helaman—
7 And it came to pass that he met Kishkumen, and he gave unto hima sign; therefore Kishkumen made known unto him the object of his desire, desiring that he would con- duct him to the judgment-seat that he might murder Helaman.
8 And when the servant of Hela- man had known all the heart of Kishkumen, and how that it was his “object to murder, and also that it was the object of all. those who belonged to his band to murder, and to rob, and to gain power, (and this was their 'secret plan, and their combination) the servant of Hela- man said unto Kishkumen: Let us go forth unto the judgment-seat.
9 Now this did please Kishkumen exceedingly, for he did suppose that he should accomplish his design; but behold, the servant of Helaman, as they were going forth unto the judgment-seat, did stab Kishkumen even to the heart, that he fell dead without a groan. And he ran and told Helaman all the things which he had seen, and heard, and done.
10 And it came to pass that Hela- man did send forth to take this band of robbers and “secret murder- ers, that they might be executed according to the law.
11 But behold, when Gadianton had found that Kishkumen did not return he feared lest that he should be destroyed; therefore he caused that his band should follow him. And they took their flight out of

the land, by a secret way, into. the wilderness; and thus when Helaman sent forth to take them they could nowhere be found.
12 And more of this Gadianton shall be spoken hereafter. And thus ended the forty and second year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.
13 And behold, in the end of this book ye shall see that this “Gadian- ton did prove the overthrow, yea, almost the entire destruction of the people of Nephi.
14 Behold I do not mean the end of the book of Helaman, but I mean the end of the book of Nephi, from which I have taken all the account which I have written.
CHAPTER 3
Many Nephites migrate to the land northward—They build houses. of cement and keep many records—Tens of thousands are converted and bap- tized—The word of God leads men to salvation—Nephi the son of Helaman fills the judgment seat.
AND now it came to pass in the *forty and third year of the reign of the judges, there was no contention among the people of Nephi save it were a little pride which was in the church, which did cause some little dissensions among the people, which affairs were settled in the ending of the forty and third year.
2 And. there was no.contention among the people in the forty and fourth year; neither was there much contention in the forty and fifth year.
3 And it came to pass in the tforty and sixth, yea, there was much con- tention and many dissensions ; in the which there were an exceedingly great many who departed out of the land of Zarahemla, and went forth
13a Hel. 6: 18; 3 Ne. 4: 1.
6a Mosiah 8: 8; 21: 26
372
unto the land “northward to inherit the land.
4 And they did travel to an exceed- ingly great distance, insomuch that they came to “large bodies of water and many rivers.
5 Yea, and even they did spread forth into all parts of the land, into whatever parts it had not been rendered desolate and without timber, because of the many in- habitants who had before inherited the land.
6 And now no part of the land was desolate, save it were for timber; but because of the greatness of the *destruction of the people who had before inhabited the land it was called. desolate.
7 And there being but little timber upon the face of the land, neverthe- less the people who went forth be- came exceedingly “expert in the working of cement; therefore they did build houses of cement, in the which they did dwell.
8 And it came to pass that they did multiply and spread, and did go forth from the land southward to the land northward, and did spread insomuch that they began to cover the face of the whole earth, from the sea south to the sea north, from the sea “west to the sea east.
9 And the people who were in the land northward did dwell in “tents, and in houses of cement, and they did suffer whatsoever tree should spring up upon the face of the land that it should grow up, that in time they might have timber to build their houses, yea; their cities, and their temples, and their synagogues, and their sanctuaries, and allmanner of their buildings.
10 And it came to pass as timber was exceedingly scarce in the land northward, they did send forth much by the way of “shipping.

11 And thus they did enable the people in the land northward that they might build many cities, both of wood and of cement.
12 And it came to_pass that there were many of the “people of Ammon, who were Lamanites by birth, did also go forth into this land.
13 And now there are many "records kept of the proceedings of this people, by many of this people, which are particular and very large, concerning them.
14 But behold, a “hundredth part of the proceedings of this people, yea, the account of the Lamanites and of the Nephites, and their wars, and contentions, and _ dissensions, and their preaching, and their prophecies, and their shipping and their building of ships, and their building of temples, and. of syn- agogues and their ‘sanctuaries, and their righteousness, and_ their wickedness, and their murders, and their robbings, and their plunder- ing, and all manner of abominations and whoredoms,. cannot be con- tained in this work.
15. But behold, there are many books and many “records of every kind, and they. have been kept chiefly by the Nephites.
16 And they have been “handed down from one generation to another by the Nephites, even until they have fallen into transgression and have been murdered, plundered, and hunted, and driven forth, and slain, and ’scattered upon the face of the earth, and mixed with the Laman- ites until they are ‘no more called the Nephites, becoming wicked, and wild, and. ferocious, yea, even be- coming Lamanites.
17 And now I return again to mine account; therefore, what I have spoken had passed after there had

15a 3 Ne. 5:9; 4 Ne. 1: 48. 16a 1 Ne. 5: 18 (16--19);

been great contentions, and distur- bances, and wars, and dissensions, among the people of Nephi.
18 The forty and sixth year of the reign of the judges ended;
19 And it came to pass that there was still great contention in the land, yea, even in the *forty and seventh year, and also in the forty and eighth year.
20 Nevertheless *Helaman did fill the judgment-seat with justice and equity; yea, he did observe to keep the statutes, and the judgments, and the commandments of God; and he did do that which was right in the sight of God continually; and he did walk after the ways of his father, in- somuch that he did prosper in the land.
21 And it came to pass that he had two sons. He gave unto the eldest the name of “Nephi, and unto the youngest, the name of ’Lehi. And they began to growupuntothe Lord.
22 And it came to pass that the wars and contentions began to cease, ina small degree, among the people of the Nephites, in the latter end of the forty and eighth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.
23 And it came to pass in the fforty and ninth year of the reign of the judges, there was continual peace established in the land, all save it were the “secret combinations which °’Gadianton the robber had estab- lished in the more settled parts of the land, which at that time were not known unto those who were at the-head of government; therefore they were not destroyed out of the land.
24 And it came to pass that in this same year there was exceedingly great prosperity in the church, in- somuch that there were thousands who did “join themselves unto the

25 And so great was the prosperity of the church, and so many the blessings which were poured out upon the people, that even the high priests and the teachers were them- selves astonished beyond measure.
26 And it came to pass that the work of the Lord did prosper unto the baptizing and uniting to the church of God, many souls, yea, even tens of thousands.
27 Thus we may see that the Lord is merciful unto all who will, in the sincerity of their hearts, call upon his holy name.
28 Yea, thus we see that the “gate of heaven is open unto “all, even to those who will believe on the name of Jesus Christ, who is the Son of God.
29 Yea, we see that whosoever will may lay hold upon the “word of God, which is °quick and powerful, which shall ‘divide asunder all the cunning and the snares and the wiles of the devil, and lead the man of Christ ina strait and ¢narrow courseacross that everlasting ‘gulf of misery which is prepared to engulf the wicked—
30 And land their souls, yea, their immortal souls, at the “right hand of God in the kingdom of heaven, to sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and with Jacob, and with all our holy fathers, to go no more out.
31 And in this year there was con- tinual rejoicing in the land of Zarahemla, and in all the regions round about, even in all the land which was possessed by the Ne- phites.
32 And it came to pass that there was peace and exceedingly great joy

in the remainder of the forty and ninth year; yea, and also there was continual peace and great joy in the fiftieth year of the reign of the judges.
33 And in the *fifty and first year |
of the reign of the judges there was
peace also, save it were the pride |
which began to enter into the church
—not into the church of God, but |
into the hearts of the people who “professed to belong to the church of God—
34 And they were lifted up in “pride, even to the persecution of many of
their brethren. Now this was a great |
evil, which did cause the more humble part of the people to suffer great persecutions, and to wade through much affliction.
35 Nevertheless they did “fast and |
*pray oft, and did wax stronger and stronger in their ‘humility, and firmer and firmer in the faith of Christ, unto the filling their souls with joy and consolation, yea, even to the “purifying and the ‘sanctification of their hearts, which sanctification cometh because of their “yielding theirhearts unto God.
36 And it came to pass that the fifty and second year ended in peace also, save it were the exceedingly great pride which had gotten into the hearts of the people; and it was because of their exceedingly great “riches and their prosperity in the land; and it did grow upon them from day to day.
37 And it came to pass in the ffifty and third year of the reign of the judges, *“Helaman died, and -his eldest son ’Nephi began to reign in his stead. And it came to pass that he did fill the judgment-seat with justice and equity; yea, he did keep

CHAPTER 4
Nephite dissenters and the Lamanites join forces and take the land of Zarahemla—The Nephites’ defeats come because of their wickedness— The Church dwindles and the people become weak like the Lamanites.
AND it came to pass in the *fifty and fourth year there were many dissensions in the church, and there was also a “contention among the people, insomuch that there was much. bloodshed.
2 And the rebellious part were slain and driven out of the land, and they did go unto the king of the Laman- ites.
3 And it came to pass that they did endeavor to stir up. the Lamanites to *war against the Nephites; but be- hold, the Lamanites. were °exceed- ingly afraid, insomuch that they would not hearken to the words of those dissenters.
4 But it came to pass in the fifty and sixth year of the reign of the judges, there were “dissenters who went up from the Nephites unto the Lamanites; and they succeeded with those others in °stirring them up to anger against the Nephites; and they were all that year pre- paring for war.
5 And in the ftfifty and seventh year they did come down against the Nephites to battle, and they did commence the work of death; yea, insomuch that in the fifty and eighth year of the reign of the judges they succeeded in obtaining @nossession of the land of Zarahemla ; yea, and also all the lands, even unto the land which was near the land Bountiful.

of Moronihah were driven even into the land of Bountiful;
7 And there they did fortify against the Lamanites, from the west sea, even unto the east; it being a “day’s journey for a Nephite, on the line which they had fortified and stationed their armies to defend their north country.
8 And thus those “dissenters of the Nephites, with the help of a numer- ous army of the Lamanites, had obtained all the possession of the Nephites which was in the land southward. And all this was done in the fifty and eighth and ninth years of the reign of the judges.
9 And it came to passin the sixtieth year of the reign of the judges, Moronihah did succeed with his armies in obtaining many parts of the land; yea, they regained many cities which had fallen into thehands of the Lamanites.
10 And it came to pass in the ¢sixty and first year of the reign of the judges they succeeded in regaining even the half of all their possessions.
11 Now this great loss of the Nephites, and the great slaughter which was among them, “would not have happened had it not been for their wickedness and their abomi- nation which was among them; yea, and it was among those also who professed to belong to the church of God.
12 And it was because of the “pride of their hearts, because of their exceeding riches, yea, it was because of their oppression to the ‘poor, withholding their food from the hungry, withholding their cloth- ing from the naked, and smiting their humble brethren upon’ the cheek, making a“mock of that which was sacred, denying the spirit of prophecy and of revelation, murder- ing, plundering, lying, stealing,

committing adultery, rising up in great contentions, and deserting away into the land of Nephi, among the Lamanites—
13 And because of this their great wickedness, and their “boastings in their own strength, they were left in their own strength; therefore they did not prosper, but were afflicted and smitten, and driven before the Lamanites, until they had lost possession of almost all their lands.
14 But behold, Moronihah did preach many things unto the people because of their iniquity, and also >’Nephi and Lehi, who were the sons of Helaman, did preach many things unto the people, yea, and did prophesy many things unto them concerning their iniquities, and what should come unto them if they did not repent of their sins.
15 And it came to pass that they did repent, and inasmuch as they did repent they did begin to prosper.
16 For when Moronihah saw that they did repent he did venture to “lead them forth from place to place, and from city to city, even until they had regained the one-half of their property and the one-half of all their lands.
17 And thus ended the sixty and first year of the reign of the judges.
18 And it came to pass in the *sixty and second year of the reign of the judges, that Moronihah could obtain no more possessions over the Lamanites.
19 Therefore they did abandon their design to obtain the remainder of their lands, for so numerous were the Lamanites that it became im- possible for the Nephites to obtain more power over them; therefore Moronihah did employ all his armies in maintaining those parts which he had taken.

20-And it came to pass, because of the greatness of the number of the Lamanites the Nephites were in
great fear, lest they should be over-_
powered, and trodden down, and slain, and destroyed. 21 Yea, they began to remember
the “prophecies of Alma, and also—
the “words of Mosiah; and they saw that they had been a ‘stiffnecked people, and that they had set at 4naught the commandments of
God;
22 And that they had altered and trampled under their feet the “laws of Mosiah, or that which the Lord commanded him to give unto the people; and they saw that their laws had become corrupted, and that they had become a wicked people, insomuch that they were wicked even like unto the Lamanites.
23 And because of their iniquity the church had begun to “dwindle; and they began to disbelieve in the spirit of prophecy and in the spirit of revelation; and the judgments of God did stare them in the face.
24 And they saw that they had become “weak, like unto their brethren, the Lamanites, and that the Spirit of the Lord did no more
preserve them; yea, it had with- |
drawn from them because the Spirit of the Lord doth not °dwell in ‘un- holy ?temples—
25 Therefore the Lord did cease to preserve them by his miraculous and matchless power, for they had fallen into a state of “unbelief and awful wickedness; and they saw that the Lamanites were exceedingly more numerous than they, and except they should °’cleave unto the Lord their God they must unavoid- ably perish.
26 For behold, they saw that the strength of the Lamanites was as

great as their strength, even man for man. And thus had they fallen into this great transgression; yea, thus had they become “weak, be- cause of their transgression, in the space of "not many years.
CHAPTER 5
Nephi and Lehi devote themselves to preaching—Their names invite them to pattern their lives after their fore- bears—Christ redeems those who repent—Nephi and Lehi make many converts and are imprisoned, and fire encircles them—A cloud of darkness overshadows three hundred people— The earth shakes and a voice com- mands men to repent—Nephi and Lehi converse with angels, and the multitude are encircled by fire.
AND it came to pass that in. this *same year, behold, “Nephi °de- livered up the judgment-seat to a man whose name was °Cezoram.
2 For as their laws and their governments were established by the “yoice of the people, and they who *chose evil were ‘more numerous than they who chose good, therefore they were “ripening for destruction, for the laws had become corrupted.
3 Yea, and this was not all; they were a“stifinecked people, insomuch that they could not be governed by the law nor justice, save it were to their destruction.
4 And it came to pass that Nephi had become weary because of their iniquity; and-he yielded up the judgment-seat, and took it upon him to preach the word;of-God all the remainder of his days, and his brother Lehi also, all the remainder of his days;

5 For they remembered: the words which their “father Helaman spake unto them. And these are the words which he spake:
6 Behold, my sons, I desire that ye should remember to keep the com- mandments of God; and I would that ye should declare unto the people these words. Behold, I have given unto you the names of our first “parents who came out of the land of Jerusalem; and this I have done that when you remember your names ye may remember them; and when ye remember them ye may remember their works; and when ye remember their works ye may know how that it is said, and also written, that they were good.
7 Therefore, my sons, I would that ye should do that which is good, that it may be said:of you, and also written, even as it has been said and written of them.
8 And now my sons, behold I have somewhat more to desire of you, which desire is, that ye may not do these things that ye may boast, but that: ye may do these things to lay up for yourselves a “treasure in heaven; yea, which is eternal, and which fadeth not away; yea, that ye may have that "precious gift of eternal life, which we have reason to suppose hath been given to our fathers.
9 O remember, remember, my sons, the “words which king Benjamin spake unto his people; yea, re- member that there is no other way nor means whereby man can be saved, only through the ’atoning blood of Jesus Christ, who’ shall come; yea, remember that he com- eth to ‘redeem the “world.

10 And remember also the words which Amulek spake unto Zeezrom, 2in the city of Ammonihah; for he said unto him that the Lord surely should come to redeem his people, but that he should not come to redeem them in their sins, but to redeem them from their sins.
11 And he hath power given unto him from the Father to redeem them from their sins because of repent- ance; therefore he hath “sent his angels to declare the tidings of the conditions of repentance, which bringeth unto the power of the Redeemer, unto the salvation of their souls.
12 And now, my sons, remember, remember that it is upon the “rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your ‘foundation; that when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds, yea, his shafts in the whirlwind, yea, when all his hail and his mighty ‘storm shall beat upon you, it shall have no power over you to drag you down to the gulf of misery and endless wo, because of the rock upon which ye are built, which is a sure foundation, a foundation whereon if men build they cannot fall.
13 And it came to pass that these were the words which Helaman “taught to his sons; yea, he did teach them many things which are not written, and also many things which are written.
14 And they did remember his words; and therefore they went forth, keeping the commandments of God, to teach the word of God among all the people of Nephi, beginning at the city Bountiful;

16 And even from one city to another, until they had gone forth “among all the people of Nephi who were in the land southward; and from thence into the land of Zara- hemla, among the Lamanites.
17 And it came to pass that they did “preach with great "power, in- somuch that they did confound many of those ‘dissenters who had gone over from the Nephites, inso- much that they came forth and did confess their sins and were baptized unto repentance, and immediately returned to the Nephites to en- deavor to repair unto them the wrongs which they had done.
18 And it came to pass that Nephi and Lehi did preach unto the Lamanites with such great power and authority, for they had power and authority given unto them that they might “speak, and they also had what they should speak given unto them—
19 Therefore they did speak unto the great astonishment of the Lamanites, to the convincing them, insomuch that there were eight thousand of the Lamanites who were in the land of Zarahemla and round about “baptized unto repent- ance, and were convinced of the wickedness of the ‘traditions of their fathers.
20 And it came to pass that Nephi and Lehi did proceed from thence to go to the “land of Nephi.
21 And it came to pass that they were taken by an army of the Lamanites and cast into “prison; yea, even in that same prison in which Ammon and his brethren were cast by the servants of Limhi.

22 And after they had been cast in- to prison many days without food, behold, they went forth into the prison to take them. that they might slay them.
23 And it came to pass that Nephi and Lehi were encircled about as if by °fire, even insomuch that. they durst not lay their hands upon them for fear lest they should be burned. Nevertheless, Nephi and Lehi were not burned; and they were as stand- ing in the midst of fire and were not burned.
24 And when they saw that they were encircled about with a “pillar of fire, and that it burned them not, their hearts did take courage.
25 For they saw that the Lamanites durst not lay their hands upon them; neither durst they come near unto them, but stood.as if they were struck dumb with amazement.
26 And it came to pass that Nephi and Lehi did stand forth and began to speak unto them, saying: °*Fear not, for behold, it is God that has shown unto you this marvelous thing, in the which is shown unto you that ye cannot lay your hands on us to slay us.
27 And behold, when they had said these words, the earth shook exceed- ingly, and the walls of the prison did shake as if they were about to tumble to the earth; but behold, they did not fall. And behold, they that.were in the prison were Laman- ites and Nephites who were dissent- ers.
28 And it came to pass that they were overshadowed with a-cloud of 4darkness, and.an awful solemn fear came upon them.
29 And it came to pass that there came a “voice as if it were above the cloud of darkness, saying: Repent ye, repent ye, and seek no more to

30 And it came to pass when they heard this ?voice, and beheld that it was not a voice of thunder, neither was it a voice ofa great tumultuous noise, but behold, it was a still voice of perfect mildness, as if it had been a whisper, and it did pierce even to the very soul—
31 And notwithstanding the mild- ness of the voice, behold the earth shook exceedingly, and the walls of the prison trembled again, as if it were about to tumble to the earth; and behold the cloud of darkness, which had overshadowed them, did not disperse—
32 And behold the voice came again, saying: “Repent ye, repent ye, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand; and seek no more to destroy my servants. And it came to pass that the earth shook again, and the walls trembled.
33 And also again the third time the voice came, and did speak unto them marvelous words which 2can- not be uttered by man; and the walls did tremble again, and the earth shook as if it were about to divide asunder.
34 And it came to pass that the Lamanites could not flee because of the cloud of darkness which did overshadow them; yea, and also they were immovable because of the fear which did come upon them.
35 Now there was one among them who was a Nephite by birth, who had once belonged to the church of God but had dissented from them.
36 And it came to pass that he turned him about, and behold, he saw through the cloud of darkness the faces of Nephi and Lehi; and behold, they did “shine exceedingly,

even as the faces of angels. And he beheld that they did lift their eyes to heaven; and they were in the attitude as if talking or lifting their voices to some being whom they beheld.
37 And it came to pass that this man did cry unto the multitude, that they might turn and look. And behold, there was power given unto them that they did turn and look; and they did behold the faces of Nephi and Lehi.
38 And they said unto the man: Behold, what do all these things mean, and whois it with whom these men do converse?
39 Now the man’s name was Aminadab. And Aminadab said unto them: They do-converse with the angels of God.
40 And it came to pass that the Lamanites said unto him: *What shall we do, that this cloud of dark- ness may be removed from over- shadowing us?
41 And Aminadab said unto them: You must “repent, and cry unto the voice, even until ye shall have "faith in Christ, who was taught unto you by Alma, and ‘Amulek, and Zeez- rom; and when ye shall do this, the cloud of darkness shall be removed from overshadowing you.
42 And it came to pass that they all did begin to cry unto the voice of him who had shaken the earth; yea, they did cry even until the cloud of darkness was dispersed.
43 And it came to pass that when they cast their eyes about, and saw that the cloud of darkness was dis- persed from overshadowing them, behold, they saw that they were “encircled about, yea every soul, by a pillar of fire.
44 And “Nephi and °Lehi were in the midst of them; yea, they were encircled about; yea, they were as

if in the midst of a flaming fire, yet it did harm them not, neither did it take hold upon the walls of the
prison; and they were filled with | that ‘joy which is unspeakable and
full of glory.
45 And behold, the *Holy Spirit of God did come down from heaven, and did enter into their hearts, and they were filled as if with fire, and they could speak forth marvelous words.
46 And it came to pass that there came a voice unto them, yea, a
pleasant voice, asif it were awhisper,
saying:
47 *Peace, peace be unto you, because of your faith in my Well Beloved, who was from the founda- tion of the world.
48 And now, when they heard this they cast up their eyes as if to behold from whence the voice came; and behold, they saw the “heavens open; and angels came down out of heaven and ministered unto them.
49 And there were about three hundred souls who saw and heard these things; and they were bidden to go forth and marvel not, neither should they doubt.
50 And it came to pass that they did go forth, and did minister unto the people, declaring throughout all the regions round about all the things which they had heard and seen, insomuch that the more part of the Lamanites were “convinced of them, because of the greatness of the evidences which they had re- ceived.
51 And as many as were “convinced did lay down their weapons of war, and also their hatred and the tradi- tion of their fathers.
52 And it came to pass that they did “yield up unto the Nephites the lands of their possession.

The righteous Lamanites preach to the wicked Nephites—Both peoples prosper during an era of peace and plenty—Lucifer, the author of sin, guides the Gadianton robbers in their murders and wickedness—They take over the Nephite government.
AND it came to pass that when the sixty and second year of the reign of the judges *had ended, all these things. had happened and - the Lamanites had become, the more part of them, a righteous people, insomuch that their “righteousness did exceed that of the Nephites, because of their firmness and their steadiness in the faith.
2 For behold, there were many of the Nephites who had become “hardened and impenitent and grossly wicked, insomuch that they did reject the word of God and all the preaching and prophesying which did come among them.
3 Nevertheless, the people of the church did have great joy because of the conversion of the Lamanites, yea, because of the church of God, which had been established among them. And they did “fellowship one with another, and did rejoice one with another, and did have great
joy.
4 And it came to pass that many of the Lamanites did come down into the land of Zarahemla, and did declare unto the people of the Nephites the manner of their “con- version, and did exhort them to faith and repentance.
5 Yea, and many did “preach with exceedingly great power and author- ity, unto the bringing down many of them into the depths of humil-

ity, to be the humble followers of God and the Lamb.
6 And it came to pass that many of the Lamanites did go into the land northward; and also “Nephi and >Lehi went into the ‘land northward, to preach unto the people. And thus ended the sixty and third year.
7 And behold, there was peace in all the land, insomuch that the Nephites did go into whatsoever part of the land they would, whether among the Nephites or the Lamanites.
8 And it came to pass that the Lamanites did also go whither- soever they would, whether it were among the Lamanites or among the Nephites; and thus they did have free intercourse one with another, to “buy and ‘to sell, and to get gain, according to their desire.
9 And it came to pass that they became exceedingly rich, both the Lamanites and the Nephites; and they did have an exceeding plenty of “gold, and of silver, and of all manner of precious metals, both in the land south and in the land north.
10 Now the land south was called “Lehi, and the Jand north was called >’Mulek, which was after the “son of Zedekiah; for the Lord did bring Mulek into the land north, and Lehi into the land south.
11 And behold, there was all man- ner of gold in both these lands, and of silver, and of precious ore of every kind; and there were also curious workmen, who did “work all kinds of ore and did refine it ; and thus they did become rich.
12 They did raise grain in abun- dance, both in the north and in the south; and they did flourish exceed- ingly, both in the north and in the

13 Behold their women did toil and spin, and did *make all manner of ’cloth, of fine-twined linen and cloth of every kind, to clothe their nakedness. And thus the sixty and fourth year did pass away in
peace.
14 And in the *sixty and fifth year they did also have great joy and peace, yea, much preaching and many prophecies concerning that which was to come. And thus passed away the sixty and fifth year.
15-And it came to pass that in the tsixty and sixth year of the reign of the judges, behold,-*Cezoram was murdered by an unknown hand as he sat upon the judgment-seat. And it came to pass that in the same year, that his son, who had been ap- pointed by the people in his stead, was also murdered. And thus ended the sixty and sixth year.
16 And in the commencement of the sixty and seventh year the people began to grow exceedingly
wicked again.
17 For behold, blessed them so long with the “riches of the world that they had not been stirred up to anger, to wars, nor to bloodshed; therefore they began to set their hearts upon their riches; yea, they began to seek to get gain that they might be lifted up one above another; therefore they began to commit secret murders, and to rob and to plunder, that they might
get gain.
18 And now behold, those murder- ers and plunderers were a band who had been formed by Kishkumen and *Gadianton. And now it had come to pass that there were many, even among the Nephites, of

Gadianton’s band. But behold, they were more numerous among the more wicked part of the Lamanites. And they were called Gadianton’s | robbers and murderers.
19 And it was they who did murder the chief judge “Cezoram, and his son, while in the judgment-seat; and behold, they were not found.
20 And now it came to pass that when the Lamanites found that there were robbers among them they were exceedingly sorrowful; and they did use every means in their power to destroy them off the face of the earth.
21 But behold, Satan did stir up the “hearts of the more part of the Nephites, insomuch that they did unite with those bands of robbers, and did enter into their covenants | and their oaths, that they would protect and preserve one another in whatsoever difficult circumstances they should be placed, that they should not suffer for their murders, and their plunderings, and their ostealings.
22 And it came to pass that they did have their signs, yea, their ‘Secret signs, and their secret words; and this that they might distinguish a brother who had | entered into the covenant, that whatsoever wickedness his brother should do he should not be injured by his brother, nor by those who did belong to his band, who had taken this covenant.
23 And thus they might murder, and plunder, and steal, and commit *whoredoms and all manner of wickedness, contrary to the laws of their country and also the laws of their God.
24 And whosoever of those whe belonged to their band should reveal unto the world of their *wickedness and their abominations, should be

25 Now behold, it is these secret “oaths and covenants which Alma commanded ‘his son should not go forth -unto the world, lest they should be a means of bringing down the people unto destruction.
26 Now behold, those “secret oaths and covenants did not come forth unto Gadianton from the ’records which were delivered unto Hela- man; but behold, they were put into the heart of ‘Gadianton by that 4same being who did entice our first parents to partake of the forbidden fruit—
27 Yea, that same being who did plot with ?Cain, that if he would murder his brother Abel it should not be known unto the world. And he did plot with Cain and his follow- ers from that time forth.
28 And also it is that same being who- put it into the hearts) of the people to “build a tower sufficiently high that they might get to heaven. And it was that same being who led on the people who came from that tower into this land; who spread the works of darkness and abomina- tions over all the face of the land, until he dragged the people down to an "entire destruction, and to an everlasting hell.
29 Yea, it is that same being who put it into the heart of “Gadianton to still carry on the work of darkness, and of secret murder; and he has brought it forth from the beginning of man even down to this time.

and secret murder, and doth hand down their plots, and their oaths, and their covenants, and their plans of awful wickedness, from genera- tion to generation according as he can get hold upon the hearts of the children:of men.
31 And now behold, he had got great hold upon the hearts of the Nephites; yea, insomuch that they had become exceedingly wicked; yea, the more part of them had turned out of the “way of righteous- ness, and did *trample under: their feet the commandments of God, and did turn unto their own ways, and did build up unto themselves ‘idols of their gold and their silver.
32 And it came to pass that all these iniquities did come unto them in the space of “not many years, insomuch that a more part of it had come unto them in the sixty and seventh year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.
33. And they did grow in their iniquities in the *sixty and eighth year also, to the great sorrow and lamentation of the righteous.
34 And thus we see that the *"Nephites did begin to dwindle in unbelief, and grow in wickedness and abominations, while the Laman- ites began to grow exceedingly in the knowledge of their God; yea, they did begin to keep his statutes and commandments, and to walk in truth and uprightness before him.
35 And thus we see that the Spirit of the Lord began to “withdraw from the Nephites, because of the wickedness and the hardness of their hearts.
36 And thus we see that the Lord began to pour out his “Spirit upon the Lamanites, because of their easi-

37 And it came to pass that the Lamanites did hunt the band of robbers of Gadianton; and they did preach the word of God among the more wicked part of them, insomuch that this band of robbers was utterly destroyed from among the Laman- ites.
38 And it came to pass on the other hand, that the Nephites did build them up and support them, begin- ning at the more wicked part of them, until they had overspread all the land of the Nephites, and had seduced the more part of the right- eous until they had come down to believe in their works and partake of their spoils, and to join with them in their secret murders and combi- nations.
39 And thus they did obtain the solemanagement of the government, insomuch that they did trample under their feet and smite and rend and turn their backs upon the “poor and the meek, and the humble followers of God.
40 And thus we see that they were in an awful state, and “ripening for an everlasting destruction.
41 And it came to pass that thus ended the sixty and eighth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.

Nephi is rejected in the north and re- turns to Zarahemla—He prays upon his garden tower and then calls upon the people to repent or perish.
BEHOLD, now it came to pass in the *sixty and ninth year of the reign of the judges over the people of the Nephites, that Nephi, the son of Helaman, “returned to the land of Zarahemla from the land northward.
2 For he had been forth among the people who were in the land north- ward, and did preach the word of God unto them, and did prophesy many things unto them;
3 And they did “reject all his words, insomuch that he could not stay among them, but returned again | unto the land of his nativity.
4 And seeing the people ina state of such awful wickedness, and those Gadianton robbers filling the judg- ment-seats—having “usurped the power and authority of the land; laying aside the commandments of God, and not in the least aright before him; doing no justice unto the children of men;
5 Condemning the righteous be- cause of their righteousness; letting the guilty and the wicked go “un- punished because of their "money; and moreover to be held in office at the head of government, to rule and do according to their wills, that they might get gain and glory of the ‘world, and, moreover, that they might the more easily commit adultery, and steal, and kill, and do according to their own wills—
6 Now this great iniquity had come upon the Nephites, in the space of “not many years; and when Nephi saw it, his heart was swollen with sorrow within his breast; and he did exclaim in the agony of his soul:

7 Oh, that I could have had my days in the days when my father Nephi first came out of the land of Jerusalem, that I could have “joyed with him in the promised land; then were his people easy to be entreated, >firm to keep the commandments of God, and slow to be led to do ini- quity ; and they were quick to heark- en unto the words of the Lord—
8 Yea, if my days could have been in those days, then would my soul have had joy in the righteousness of my brethren.
9 But behold, I am consigned that these are my days, and that my soul shall be filled with “sorrow because of this the wickedness of my brethren.
10 And behold, now it came to pass that it was upon a tower, which was in the “garden of Nephi, which was by the highway which led to the chief market, which was in the city of Zarahemla; therefore, Nephi had bowed himself upon the tower which was in his garden, which tower was also near unto the garden gate by which led the highway.
11 And it came to pass that there were certain men passing by and saw Nephi as he was pouring out his soul unto God upon the “tower; and they ran and told the people what they had seen, and the people came together in multitudes that they might know the cause of so great mourning for the wickedness of the people.
12 And now, when Nephi arose he beheld the multitudes of people who had gathered together.
13 And it came to pass that he opened his mouth and said unto them: - Behold, :*’why have — ye gathered yourselves together? That I may tell you of your iniquities?

14 Yea, because I have got upon my tower that I might pour out my soul unto my God, because of the exceeding sorrow of my heart, which is because of your iniquities!
15 And because of my “mourning and lamentation ye have gathered yourselves together, and do marvel; yea, and ye have great need to marvel; yea, ye ought. to marvel because ye are given away that the devilhas got so great hold upon your hearts.
16 Yea, how could you have given way to the enticing of him who is seeking to hurl away your souls down to “everlasting misery and endless wo?

For if ye will not: repent, be- hold, this °great city, and also all those great cities which are round about, which are in the land of our possession, shall be taken away that ye shall have no place in them; for behold, the Lord will not grant unto you ‘strength, as he has hitherto done, to withstand against your enemies.

Now therefore, I would that ye should. behold, my brethren, that it shall be “better for the Lamanites than for you except ye shall repent.

Corrupt judges seek to incite the people against Nephi—Abraham, Moses, Zenos, Zenock, Ezias, Isaiah, Jere-
miah, Lehi, and Nephi all testified of |
Christ—By inspiration Nephi an- nounces the murder of the chief judge.
AND now it came to pass. that when Nephi had said these words, behold, there were men who were judges, who also belonged to the secret band of Gadianton, and they were angry, and they cried out against him, say- ing unto the people: Why do ye not seize upon this man and bring him forth, that he may be condemned according to the crime which he has done?
2 Why seest thou this man, and hearest him revile against this people and against our law?
3 For behold, Nephi had spoken unto them concerning the corrupt- ness of their law; yea, many things did Nephi speak which cannot be written; and nothing did he speak which was contrary to the command- ments of God.
4 And those judges were angry with him because he “spake plainly unto them concerning their secret works of darkness ;nevertheless, they durst not lay their own hands upon him, for they feared the people lest they should cry out against them.
5 Therefore they did cry unto the people, saying: Why do you suffer this man to revile against us? For behold he doth condemn all this

people, even unto destruction; yea, and also that these our “great cities shall be taken from us, that we shall have no place in them. .
6 And now we know’that this is impossible, .for. behold, we are “powerful, and our cities great, therefore our enemies can have no power over us.
7 Andit came to pass that thus they did “stir up the people to anger against Nephi, and raised con- tentions among them; for there were some who did cry out: Let this man alone, for he is a good:‘man, and those things which he saith will surely come to pass except we re- pent;
8 Yea, behold, all the judgments will come upon us which he has testified unto us; for we know that he has testified aright unto us con- cerning our iniquities. And behold they are many, and he *knoweth as well all things which shall befall us as he knoweth of our iniquities;
9 Yea, and behold, if he had not been a prophet he could not have "testified concerning those things.
10 And it came to pass that those people who sought to destroy Nephi were compelled because of their fear, that they did not lay their hands on him; therefore he began again to speak unto them, seeing that he had gained favor in the eyes of some, insomuch that the remainder of them did fear.
11 Therefore he was constrained to speak more unto them saying: Be- hold, my brethren, have ye not read that God gave power unto one man, even Moses, to smite upon the waters of the Red *Sea, and they parted hither and thither, insomuch that
HELAMAN 8:6-18
the Israelites, who were our fathers, came through upon dry ground, and the waters closed upon the armies of the Egyptians and swal- lowed them up?
12 And now behold, if God gave unto this man such power, then why should ye dispute among your- selves, and say that he hath given unto me no power whereby I may *know concerning the judgments that shall come upon you except ye repent?
13 But, behold, ye not only deny my words, but ye also deny all the words which have been spoken by our fathers, and also the words which were spoken by this man, Moses, who had such great power given unto him, yea, the words which he hath spoken concerning the coming of the Messiah.
14 Yea, did he not bear record that the Son of God should come? And as he “lifted up the brazen serpent in the wilderness, even so shall he be lifted up who should come.
15 And as many as should look upon that serpent should “live, even so aS many as should look upon the Son of God with faith, having a con- trite spirit, might “live, even unto that life which is eternal.
16 And now behold, Moses did not only testify of these things, but also ¢all the holy prophets, from his days even to the days of Abraham.
17 Yea, and behold, “Abraham saw of his coming, and was filled with gladness and did rejoice.
18 Yea, and behold I say unto you, that Abraham not only knew of these. things, but there were “many before the days of Abraham who were called by the °order of God;

yea, even after the order of his Son; and this that it should be shown unto the people, a great many thousand years before his coming, that even redemption should come unto them.
19 And now I would that ye should know, that even since the days of Abraham there have been many prophets that have testified these things; yea, behold, the prophet *Zenos did testify boldly; for the which he was slain.
20 And behold, also *Zenock, and also “Ezias, and also “Isaiah, and 4Jeremiah, (Jeremiah being that same prophet who testified of the destruction of Jerusalem) and now we know that Jerusalem was destroyed according to the words of Jeremiah.

22 Our father Lehi was driven out of Jerusalem because he “testified of these things.

Messengers find the chief judge dead at the judgment seat—They are im- prisoned and later released—By inspiration Nephi identifies Seantum as the murderer—Nephi is accepted by some as a prophet.
BEHOLD, now it came to pass that when Nephihad spoken these words, certain men who were among them tan to the judgment-seat; yea, even there were “five who went, and they said among. themselves, as. they went:
2 Behold, now we will know of a surety whether this man be a prophet and God hath commanded him to prophesy such marvelous things unto us. Behold, we do not “believe that he hath; yea, we do not believe that he is a prophet; never- theless, if this thing which he has said concerning the chief judge be true, that he be dead, then will we believe that the other words which he has spoken are true.
3 And it came to pass that they ran in their might, and came in unto the judgment-seat; and behold; the chief judge had fallen to the earth, and did “lie in his blood.
4 And now behold, when they saw this they were astonished exceed- ingly, insomuch that they fell-to the earth; for they had-not believed the words which Nephi had spoken con- cerning the chief judge.
5 But now, when they saw they believed, and fear came upon them lest all the judgments which Nephi had spoken “should come upon the people; therefore they did quake, and had fallen to the earth.
6 Now, immediately when. the judge had been murdered—he being stabbed. by: his brother: by a-garb of secrecy, andhe fled, and the servants ran and told the people, raising the cry. of murder among them;
7 And behold the people did gather

themselves together unto the place of the judgment-seat—and behold, to their astonishment they saw those “five men who had fallen to the earth.
8 And now behold, the people knew nothing concerning the multitude who had gathered together at the *garden of Nephi; therefore they said among themselves: These men are they who have murdered. the judge, and God has smitten them that they could not flee from us.
9 And it came to pass that they laid hold on them, and bound them and cast them into prison. And there was a proclamation sent-abroad that the judge was slain, and: that the murderers had been taken and were cast into prison.
10 And it came to pass that on the morrow the people did assemble themselves together to “mourn and to fast, at the burial of the great chief judge who had been slain.
11 And thus also those judges who were at the garden of Nephi, and heard his words, were also gathered together at the burial.
12 And it.came to pass that they inquired among the people, saying: Where are the five who were sent to inquire concerning the chief judge whether he was dead? And they answered and said:.Concerning this five whom: ye say ye have sent, we know not; but there are five who are the murderers, whom we have cast into prison.
13 And it came to pass that the judges desired that they should be brought; and. they were brought, and behold they were the five who were sent;. and behold the judges inquired of them to know concern- ing the matter, and they told them all that they had done, saying:
14 We ran and came to the place of the judgment-seat, and when we saw all things even as Nephi had testified, we were astonished inso-

much that we fell to the earth; and when we were recovered from our astonishment, behold they cast us into “prison.
15 Now, as for the murder of this man, we know not who has done it; and only this much we know, we ran and came “according as ye desired, and behold he was dead, according to the words of Nephi.
16 And now it came to pass that the judges did expound the matter unto the people, and did cry out against Nephi, saying: Behold, we know that this Nephi must have agreed with some one'to slay the judge, and then he might declare it unto us, that he might convert us unto his faith, that he might raise himself to be a great man, chosen of God, and a prophet. .
17 And now behold, we will detect this man, and he shall confess his fault and make known unto us the true murderer of this judge.
18 And it came to pass that the five were liberated on the day of the burial. Nevertheless, they did rebuke the judges in the- words which they had spoken against Nephi, and did contend with them one by one, insomuch that they did confound them.
19 Nevertheless, they caused that Nephi should be taken and bound and brought before the multitude, and they began to question him in divers ways that they might cross him, that they might accuse him to death—
20 Saying unto him: Thou art confederate; who is this man that hath done this murder? Now tell us, and acknowledge thy fault; saying, Behold here is “money; and also we will grant unto thee thy life if thou wilt tell us, and acknowledge the agreement which thou hast made with him.
21 But Nephi said unto them:

22 O ye ought to begin to howl and ||} 4mourn, because of the great de- | struction which at this time doth await you, except ye shall repent.
23 Behold ye say that I have agreed with a man that he should murder Seezoram, our chief judge. But behold; I say unto you, that this is because I have testified unto you that ye might know concerning this thing; yea, even for a witness unto you, that I did know of the wicked- ness and abominations which are among you.
24 And because I have done this, ye say that I have agreed with a man that’he should do this thing; yea, because I showed unto you this sign ye are angry with me, and seek to destroy my life.
25 And now behold, I will show unto you another sign, and see if ye will in this thing seek to destroy me.
26 Behold I say unto you: Go to the house of Seantum, who is the “brother of Seezoram, and say unto him:
27 Has Nephi, the pretended prophet, who doth prophesy so much evil concerning this people, agreed with thee, in the which ye have murdered Seezoram, who is your brother?
28 And behold, he shall say unto you, Nay.
29 And ye shall say unto him: Have ye murdered your brother?
30 And he shall stand with fear, and wist not what to say. And be- hold, he shall deny unto you; and he shall make as if he were astonished ; nevertheless, he shall declare unto you that he is innocent. i
31 But behold, ye shall examine

him, and ye shall find.-blood upon the skirts of his cloak.
32 And when ye have seen this, ye Shall say: From whence cometh this blood? Do we not know that it is the blood of your brother?
33 And then shall he tremble, and shall look pale, even as if death had come upon him.
34 And then shall ye say: Because of this fear and this paleness which has come upon your face, behold, we know that thou art guilty.
35 And then shall greater fear come upon him; and then shall he confess unto you, and deny no more that. he has done this murder.
36 And then shall he say unto you, that I, Nephi, know nothing con- cerning the matter save it were given unto me by the power of God. And then shall.ye know that I. am an honest man, and that Iam sent unto you from God.
37 And it came to pass that they went and did, even according as Nephi had said unto them. And behold, the words which he had said were true; for according to the words he did deny; and also according to the words he did confess.
38 And he was brought to prove that he himself was the very murderer, insomuch that the five were set at liberty, and also was Nephi.
39 And there were some of the Nephites who believed on the words of Nephi; and there were some also, who believed because of the testi- mony of the five, for they had been converted while they were in prison.
40 And now there were some among the people, who said that Nephi was a prophet.
41 And there were others who said: Behold, he is a god, for except he was a god he could not “know of all things. For behold, he has told us

CHAPTER 10
The Lord gives Nephi the sealing power—He is empowered to bind and loose on earth and in heaven—He commands the people to repent or perish—The Spirit carries him from congregation to congregation.
AND it came to pass that there arose a division among the people, insomuch that they divided hither and thither and went their ways, leaving Nephi alone, as he was standing in the midst of them.
2 And it came to pass that Nephi went his way towards his own house, *pondering upon the things which the Lord had shown unto him.
3 And it came to pass as he was thus pondering—being much cast down. because of the wickedness of the people of the Nephites, their secret works of darkness, and their murderings, and their plunderings, and all manner of iniquities—and it came to pass as he was thus ponder- ing in his heart, behold, a “voice came unto him saying:
4 “Blessed art thou, Nephi, for those things which thou hast done; for I have beheld how thou hast with >bunwearyingness declared the word, which I have given unto thee, unto this. people. And thou hast not feared them, and hast not sought thine ‘own life, but hast sought my 4will, and to keep my command- ments.
5 And now, because thou hast done this with such unwearyingness, be- hold, I will bless thee forever; and I will make thee mighty in word and in deed, in faith and in works; yea, even that “all things shall be °done

unto thee according to thy ‘word, for thou shalt ¢not ask that which is contrary to my will.
6 Behold, thou art Nephi, and I am God. Behold, I declare it unto thee in the presence of mine angels, that ye shall have power over this people, and shall smite the earth with “famine, and with pestilence, and destruction, according to the wickedness of this people.
7 Behold, I give unto you “power, that whatsoever ye shall ’seal on earth shall be sealed in heaven; and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven; and thus shall ye have power among this people.
8 And thus, if ye shall say unto this temple it shall be rent in twain, it shall be done.
9 And if ye shall say unto this *mountain, Be thou cast down and become smooth, it shall be done.
10 And behold, if ye shall say that God shall smite this people, it shall come to pass.
11 And now behold, I command you, that ye shall go and declare unto this people, that thus saith the Lord God, who is the Almighty: Except ye repent ye shall be smitten, even unto “destruction.
12 And behold, now it came to pass that when the Lord had spoken these words unto Nephi, he did stop and did not go unto his own house, but did return unto the multitudes who were scattered about upon the face of the land, and began to declare unto them the word of the Lord which had been spoken unto him, concerning their destruction if they did not repent.

16 But behold, the power of God was with him, and they could not | take him to cast him into prison, | for he was taken by the Spirit and | “conveyed away out of the midst of | them.
17 And it came to pass that thus he did go forth in the Spirit, from multitude to multitude, declaring the word of God, even until he had declared it unto them all, or sent it forth among all the people.
18 And it came to pass that they would not hearken unto his words; and there began to be contentions, | insomuch that they were divided | against themselves and began to | slay one another with the sword.
19 And thus ended the seventy and | first year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi. if

AND now it came tospass in the *seventy and second year of the Teign of the judges that the con- tentions did increase, insomuch that there were wars throughout all the land among all the people of Nephi.
2 And it was this “secret band of robbers who did carry on this work of destruction and wickedness. And this war did last all that year; and in the {seventy and third year it did also last.
3 And it came to pass that in this year Nephi did cry unto the Lord, saying:
4 O Lord, do not suffer that this people shall be destroyed by the sword; but O Lord, rather “let there bea "famine in the land, to stir them up in remembrance of the Lord their God, and perhaps they. will repent and turn unto thee.
5 And so it was done, according to the words of Nephi..And there was a great famine upon-the land, among all the people of Nephi. And thus in the tseventy and fourth year the famine did continue, and the work of destruction did cease by the sword but became sore by famine.
6 And this work of destruction did also continue in the §seventy and fifth year. For the earth was smitten that it was “dry, and did not yield forth grain in the season of grain; and the whole earth. was smitten, even among the Lamanites as. well as among the Nephites, so that they were smitten that they did perish by thousands in the more wicked parts of the land.
7 And it came to pass that the people saw that they were about to perish by famine, and they began to “remember the Lord their God; and they began to remember the words of Nephi.
8 And the people “began to plead with their chief judges and their

leaders, that they would say unto Nephi: Behold, we know that thou art a man of God, and therefore cry unto the Lord our God that he turn away from us this famine, lest all the words which thou hast spoken con- cerning our “destruction be fulfilled.
9 And it came to pass that the judges did say unto Nephi, accord- ing to the words which had been desired. And it came to pass that when Nephi saw that the people had “repented and did humble them- selves in sackcloth, he cried again unto. the Lord, saying:
10 O. Lord, behold this people repenteth; and they have swept away the band of Gadianton from amongst them insomuch that they have become extinct, and they have concealed their secret plans in the earth.
11 Now, O Lord, because of this their humility wilt thou turn away thine anger, and let thine anger be appeased in the destruction of those wicked men whom thou hast already destroyed.
12 O Lord, wilt thou turn away thine anger, yea, thy fierce anger, and cause that this famine may cease in this land.
13.0 Lord, wilt thou hearken unto me, and cause that it may be done according to my words, and send forth “rain upon the face of the earth, that she may bring forth her fruit, and her grain in the season of grain.
140 Lord, thou didst hearken unto "my words when I said, Let there be a famine, that the pestilence of the sword might cease; and I know that thou wilt, even at this time, hearken unto my words, for thou saidst that: If this people repent I will spare them.
15. Yea, O Lord, and thou seest that they have repented, because of the famine and the pestilence and

destruction which has come unto them.
16 And now, O Lord, wilt thou turn away thine anger, and try again if they will serve thee? And if so, O Lord, thou canst bless them accord- ing to thy words which thou hast said.
17 And it came to pass that in the *seventy and sixth year the Lord did turn away his anger from the people, and caused that “rain should fall upon the earth, insomuch that it did bring forth her fruit in the season of her fruit. And it came to pass that it did bring forth her grain in the season of her grain.
18 And behold, the people did re- joice and glorify God, and the whole face of the land was.filled with re- joicing; and they did no more seek to destroy Nephi, but they did esteem himasa“great prophet, anda man of God, having great power and authority given unto him from God.
19 And behold, Lehi, his brother, was not a *whit behind him as to things pertaining to righteousness.
20 And thus it did come to pass that the people of Nephi began to prosper again in the land, and be- gan to build up their waste places, and began to multiply and spread, even until they did “cover the whole face of the land, both on the northward and on the southward, from the sea west to the sea east.
21 And it came to pass that the seventy and sixth year did end in peace. And the seventy and seventh year began in peace; and the “church did spread throughout the face of all the land; and the more part of the people, both the Nephites and the Lamanites, did belong to the church; and they did have exceedingly great peace in the land; and thus ended the seventy and seventh year.
22 And also they had peace in the

seventy and eighth year, save it were a few contentions concerning the points of doctrine which had been laid down by the prophets.
23 And in the tseventy and ninth year there began to be much strife. But it came to pass that Nephi and Lehi, and many of their brethren who knew concerning the true points of doctrine, having many ¢revela- tions daily, therefore they did preach unto the people, insomuch that they did put an end to their strife in that same year.
24 And it came to pass that in the teightieth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi, there were a certain number of the dissenters from the people of Nephi, who had some years before gone over unto the Lamanites, and taken upon themselves the name of Lamanites, and also a certain num- ber who were real descendants of the Lamanites, being stirred up to anger by them, or by those dissent- ers, therefore they commenced a ¢war with their brethren.
25 And they did commit murder and plunder; and then they would retreat back into the mountains, and into the wilderness and secret places, hiding themselves that they could not be discovered, receiving daily an addition to their numbers, inasmuch as there were dissenters that went forth unto them.
26 And thus in time, yea, even in | the space of “not many years, they became an exceedingly great band of robbers; and they did search out all the ’secret plans of Gadianton; and thus they became robbers of Gadianton.
27 Now behold, these robbers did make great havoc, yea, even great — destruction among the people of Nephi, and also among the people of the Lamanites.

28 And it came to pass that it was expedient that there should be a stop put to this work of destruction; therefore they sent an army of strong men into the wilderness and upon the mountains to’search out this band of robbers, and to destroy them.
29 But behold, it came to pass that in that same year they were driven back even into their own lands: And thus ended the eightieth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.
30,And it came to pass in: the *commencement of the eighty and first year they did go forth again against this band of robbers, and did destroy many; and they were also visited with much destruction.
31 And they were again obliged to return out of the wilderness and out of the “mountains. unto their own lands, because- of the exceeding greatness of the numbers: of those robbers who infested the mountains and the wilderness.
32 And it came to pass that thus ended this year..And the robbers did still increase and wax strong, in- somuch that they did defy the whole armies of the Nephites, and also of the Lamanites; and they did cause great fear to come unto the people upon all the face of the land.
33 Yea, for they did visit many parts of the land, and did do great destruction unto them; yea, did kill many, and did carry away others captive into the wilderness, yea, and more especially their women and their children.
34 Now this great evil, which came unto the people because of their iniquity, did stir them up again in “remembrance of the Lord their God.

4 O how “foolish, and how vain, and how evil, and devilish, and how °quick to do iniquity, and how slow to do good, are the children of men; yea, how quick to hearken unto the words of the evil one, and to set their ‘hearts upon the vain things of the world!

6 Behold, they do not desire that the Lord their God, who hath *created them, should "rule and reign over them; notwithstanding his great goodness and his mercy towards them, they do set at ‘naught his counsels, and they will not that he should be their guide.

15 And thus, according to his word the ’earth goeth back, and it appeareth unto man that the °sun standeth still; yea, and behold, this is so; for surely it is the earth that moveth and not the sun.
16 And behold, also, if he say unto the “waters of the great deep—’Be thou dried up—it is done.
17 Behold, if he say unto this mountain—Be thou raised up, and *come over and fall upon that city, that it be buried up—behold it is done.
18 And behold, if a man “hide up a treasure in the earth, and the Lord shall say—Let it be “accursed, because of the iniquity of him who hath hid it up—behold, it shall be accursed.
19 And if the Lord shall say—Be thou accursed, that no man shall find thee from this time henceforth and forever—behold, no man get- teth it henceforth and forever.

20 And behold, if the Lord shall say unto a man—Because: of thine iniquities, thou shalt be accursed *forever—it shall be done
21 And if the Lord shall say— Because of thine iniquities thou shalt be “cut off from my presence— he will cause that it shall be so.
22 And wo unto him to whom he shallsay this, for it shall be unto him that will do iniquity, and he cannot be “saved; therefore, for this cause, that men might be saved, hath repentance been declared.
23 Therefore, blessed are they who will repent and hearken unto the voice of the Lord their God; for these are they that shall be saved.
24 And may God grant, in his great fulness, that men might be brought unto repentance and good works, that they might be restored unto grace for “grace, according to their works.
25 And I would that all men might be saved. But. we read that in the *sreat and last day there are some who shall be cast out, yea, who shall be cast off from the "presence of the Lord;
26 Yea, who shall be consigned toa state of endless misery, fulfilling the words which say: They that have done good shall have “everlasting life; and they that have done evil shall have everlasting °damnation. And thus it is. Amen.

AND now it came to pass in the *eighty and sixth year, the Nephites did still remain in wickedness, yea, in great wickedness, while the *Lamanites did observe strictly to keep the commandments of God, according to the law of Moses.
2 And it came to pass that in this year there was one “Samuel, a >’Lamanite, came into the land of Zarahemla, and began to preach unto the people. And it came to pass that he did preach, many days, repentance unto the people, and they did ‘cast him out, and he was about to ¢return to his own land.
3 But behold, the “voice of the Lord came unto him, that he should return again, and prophesy unto the people whatsoever things should come into his "heart.
4 And it came to pass that they would not suffer that he should enter into the city; therefore he went and got upon the “wall thereof, and stretched forth his hand and cried with a loud voice, and ’prophesied unto the people whatsoever things the Lord put into his heart.
5 And he'said unto them: Behold, I, Samuel, a Lamanite, do speak the words of the Lord which he doth put into my heart;:and behold he hath put it into my heart to say unto this people that the “sword of justice hangeth over this people; and four hundred years pass not away save the sword of justice falleth upon this people.

7 And behold, an “angel of the Lord hath declared it unto me, and he did bring “glad tidings to my soul. And behold, I was sent unto you to declare it unto you also, that ye might have glad tidings; but behold ye would ‘not receive me.
8 Therefore, thus saith the Lord: Because of the hardness of the hearts of the people of the Nephites, except they repent I will take away my word from them, and I will ¢with- draw my Spirit from them, and I will suffer them no longer, and I will turn the hearts of their brethren against them.
9 And “four hundred years shall not pass away before I will cause that they shall be smitten; yea, I will visit them with the sword and with famine and with pestilence.
10 Yea, I will visit them in my fierce anger, and there shall be those of the “fourth generation who shall live, of your enemies, to behold your utter destruction; and this shall surely come except ye repent, saith the Lord; and those of the fourth generation shall visit your destruc- tion.
11 But if ye will repent and “return unto the Lord your God I will turn away mine anger, saith the Lord; yea, thus saith the Lord, blessed are they who will repent and turn unto me, but wo unto him that repenteth not.

25 And now when ye talk, ye say: If our days had been in the days of our “fathers of old, we would not have "slain the prophets; we would not have stoned them, and: cast them out.

27 But behold, if a man shall come among you and shall say: Do this, and there is no iniquity; do that and ye shall not suffer; yea, he will say: *Walk after the pride of your own hearts; yea, walk after the pride of your eyes, and do whatsoever your heart desireth—and if a man shall come among you. and say this, ye will receive him, and say that he is a "prophet.

30 Yea, behold, the anger of the Lord is already kindled against you; behold, he hath cursed the land because of your iniquity.
31 And behold, the time cometh that he curseth your riches, that they become “slippery, that ye can- not hold them; and in the days of your poverty ye cannot retain them.
32 And in the days of your poverty ye shall cry unto the Lord; and in vain shall ye cry, for your desolation is already come upon you, and your destruction is made sure; and then shall ye weep and howl in that day, saith the Lord of Hosts. And then shall ye lament, and say:
33 O *that I had repented, and had not killed:‘the prophets, and ’stoned them, and cast them out. Yea, in that day ye shall say: O that we had remembered the Lord our God in the day that he gave us our riches, and then they would not have be- come slippery that we should lose them; for behold, our riches are gone from us.
34 Behold, we lay a tool here and on the morrow it is gone; and behold, our swords are taken from us in the day we have sought them for battle.
35 Yea, we have hid up our ‘treasures and they have slipped away from us, because of the curse of the land.

day that the word of the Lord came | unto us; for behold the land is cursed, and all things are become slippery, and we cannot hold them.
37 Behold, we are surrounded by “demons, yea, we are encircled about by the angels of him who hath | sought to destroy our souls. Behold, our iniquities are great. O Lord, canst thou not turn away thine anger from us? And this shall be your language in those days.
38 But behold, your “days of pro- bation are past; ye have °pro- crastinated the day of your salva- tion until it is everlastingly too late, and your destruction is made sure; yea, for ye have sought all the days of your lives for that which ye could not obtain; and ye have sought for ‘happiness in doing iniquity, which thing is contrary to the nature of that righteousness which is in our great and Eternal Head.
39 O ye people of the land, that ye would hear my words! And I pray that the anger of the Lord be turned away from you, and that ye would repent and be saved.

4 Therefore, there shall be one “day and a night and a day, as if it were one day and there were no night; and this shall be-unto you for a sign; for ye shall know of the rising of the sun and also of its setting; therefore they shall know of a surety that there shall be two days and a night; nevertheless the night shall not be darkened; and it shall be the night before he is "born.

11 And ye shall “hear my words, for, for this intent have I come up upon the walls of this city, that ye might hear and know of the judg- ments of God which do await you because of your iniquities, and also that ye might know the conditions of repentance;

19 Therefore repent ye, repent ye, lest by knowing these things. and not doing them ye shall suffer your- selves to come under:condemnation, and ye are brought down unto this second death.
20 But behold, as I said unto you concerning another “sign, a sign of his death, behold, in that day that he shall suffer death the sun shall be darkened and refuse to give his ‘light unto you; and also the moon and the stars; and there shall be no light upon the face of this land, even from the time that he shall suffer death, for the space of ‘three days, to the time that he shall rise again from the dead.
21 Yea, at the time that he shall yield up the “ghost there shall be *thunderings and lightnings for the space of many hours, and the earth shall shake and tremble; and the ‘rocks which are upon the face of this earth, which are both above the earth and beneath, which ye know

23 And behold, there shall be great “tempests, and there shall be many mountains laid low, like unto a valley, and there shall be many places which are now called °valleys which shall become mountains, whose height is great.
24 And “many highways shall be broken up, and many cities shall become desolate.
25 And many “graves.shall be opened, and shall yield up many of their dead; and many saints shall appear unto many.
26 And behold, thus hath the “angel spoken unto me; for he said unto me that there should be thunderings and lightnings for the space of many hours.
27 And he said unto me that while the thunder and the lightning lasted, and the tempest, that these things should be, and that “darkness should cover the face of the whole earth for the space of three days.
28 And the angel said unto me that many shall see greater things than these, to the intent that they might believe that “these signs and these wonders should come to pass upon all the face of this land, to the intent that there should be no cause for unbelief among the children of men—

5 And I would that ye should be- hold that the “more part of them are in the path of their duty, and they do walk circumspectly before God, and they do observe to keep his commandments and his statutes and his judgments according to the law of Moses.
6 Yea, I say unto you, that the more part of them are doing this, and they are striving with “un- wearied diligence that they may bring the remainder of their breth- ren to the knowledge of the truth; therefore there are many who do add to their numbers daily.
7 And behold, ye do know of your- selves, for ye have witnessed it, that as many of them as.are brought to the knowledge of the truth, and to know of the wicked and abominable traditions of their fathers, and are led to believe the holy scriptures, yea, the prophecies of the holy prophets, which are written, which

leadeth them to faith on the Lord, and unto repentance, which faith and repentance bringeth a “change of heart unto them—
8 Therefore, as many as have come to this, ye know of yourselves are "firm and steadfast in the faith, and in the thing wherewith they have been made free.
9 And ye know also that they have “buried their weapons of war, and they fear to take them up lest by any means they should sin; yea, ye can see that they fear to sin—for behold they will suffer themselves that they be trodden down and slain by their enemies, and will not lift their swords against them, and this because of their ’faith in Christ.
10 And now, because of their “steadfastness when they do believe in that thing which they do believe, for because of their firmness when they are once enlightened, behold, the Lord shall bless them and pro- long their days, notwithstanding their iniquity—
11 Yea, even if they should dwindle in unbelief the Lord shall “prolong their days, until the time shall come which hath been spoken of by our fathers, and also by the prophet »Zenos, and many other prophets, concerning the ‘restoration of our brethren, the Lamanites, again to the knowledge of the truth—
12 Yea, I say unto you, that in the latter times the “promises of the Lord have been extended to our brethren, the Lamanites; and not- withstanding the many afflictions which they shall have, and not- withstanding they shall be "driven to and fro upon the face of the earth, and be hunted, and shall be smitten
404,
and scattered abroad, having no place for ‘refuge, the Lord shall be “merciful unto them.
13 And this is according to the prophecy, that they shall again be "brought to the true knowledge, which is the knowledge of their Redeemer, and their great and true "shepherd, and be numbered | among his “sheep.
14 Therefore I say unto you, it shall be “better for them than for you except ye repent.
15 For behold, “had the mighty works been shown unto them which have been shown unto you, yea, unto them who have dwindled in unbelief because of the traditions of their fathers, ye can see of your- selves that they never would again have dwindled in unbelief.
16 Therefore, saith the Lord: I will not utterly destroy them, but I will cause that in the day of my wisdom | they shall “return again unto me, saith the Lord.
17 And now behold, saith the Lord, concerning the people of the Ne- phites: If they will not repent, and observe to do my will, I will utterly “destroy them, saith the Lord, because of their unbelief notwith- standing the many mighty works which I have done among them; and as surely as the Lord liveth shall these things be, saith the Lord.

AND now, it came to pass that there were many who heard the words of Samuel, the Lamanités“which he spake upon the “walls of the city. And as many as believed on his word went forth and sought for Nephi; and when they had come forth and found him they confessed unto him their sins and denied not, desiring that they might be “bap-
‘tized unto the Lord.
2 But as many as there were who did not believe in the words of Samuel were “angry with him; and they cast stones at him upon the wall, and also many shot arrows at him as he stood upon the wall; but the Spirit of the Lord was with him, insomuch that they could not hit him with their stones neither with their arrows.
3 Now when they saw that they could not hit him, there were many more who did believe on his words, insomuch that they went away unto Nephi to be baptized.
4 For behold, Nephi was baptizing, and prophesying, and preaching, crying repentance unto the people, showing signs and wonders, working °"miracles among the people, that they might know that the Christ must "shortly come—
5 Telling them of things which must shortly come, that they might know and remember at the time of their coming that they had been made known unto them beforehand, to the intent that they might believe; therefore as many as believed on the words of Samuel went forth unto him to be baptized, for they came repenting and con- fessing their sins.
6 But the ?more part of them did not believe in the words of Samuel; therefore when they saw that they could not hit him with their stones and their arrows, they cried unto their captains, saying: ’Take this

fellow and bind him, for behold he ‘hath a devil; and because of the power of the devil which is in him we cannot hit him with our stones and our arrows; therefore take him and bind him, and away with him.
7 And as they went forth to lay their hands on him, behold, he did cast himself down from the wall, and did-flee out of their lands, yea, even unto his own country, and began to preach and to prophesy “among his own people.
8 And behold, he was never heard of more among the Nephites; and thus were the affairs of the people.
9 And thus ended the eighty and sixth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.
10 And thus ended also the *eighty and seventh year of the reign of the judges, the more part of the people remaining in their pride and wicked- ness, and the lesser part walking more circumspectly before God.
11 And these were the conditions also, in the eighty and eighth year of the reign of the judges.
12 And there was but little altera- tion in the affairs of the people, save it were the people began to be more hardened in iniquity, and do more and more of that which was “con- trary to the commandments of God, in the eighty and ninth year of the reign of the judges.
13 But it came to pass in the fnine- tieth year of the reign of the judges, there were “great signs given unto the people, and wonders; and the words of the prophets "began to be fulfilled.
14 And “angels did appear unto men, wise men, and did declare unto them glad tidings of great joy; thus in this year the scriptures began to be fulfilled.
15 Nevertheless, the people began to harden their hearts, all save it were the most believing part of them, both of the Nephites and also of the

Lamanites, and began to depend upon their “own strength and upon their own wisdom, saying:
16 Some things they may have guessed right, among so many; but behold, we know that all these great and marvelous works cannot come to pass, of which has been spoken.
17 And they began to reason and to contend among themselves, saying:
18 That it is “not reasonable that such a being as a Christ shall come; if so, and he be the Son of God, the Father of heaven and of earth, as it has been spoken, why will he not show himself unto us as well as unto them who shall be at Jerusalem?
19 Yea, why will he not show him- self in this land as well as in the land of Jerusalem?
20 But behold, we know that this is a wicked “tradition, which has been handed down unto us by our fathers, to cause us that we should believe in some great and marvelous thing which should come to pass, but not among us, but in a land which is far distant, a land which we know not; therefore they can keep us in ignorance, for we cannot °witness with our own eyes that they are true.

22 And many more things did the | people “imagine up in their hearts, | which were foolish and °vain; and | they were much disturbed, for Satan |} did stir them up to do iniquity con- |
tinually; yea, he did go about jj spreading ‘rumors and contentions }}
upon all the face of the land, that he might harden the hearts of the people against that which was good jf and against that which should come.
23 And notwithstanding the signs and the wonders which were wrought among the people of the Lord, and the many miracles which they did, Satan did get great hold upon the hearts of the people upon all the face of the land.
24 And thus *ended the ninetieth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.
25 “And thus ended the book of Helaman, according to the record of |} Helaman and his sons.

THE BOOK OF NEPHI
THE SON OF NEPHI, WHO WAS THE SON OF HELAMAN
And Helaman was the son of Helaman, who was the son of Alma, who was the son of Alma, being a descendant of Nephi whowas the son of Lehi, who came out of Jerusalem in the first year of the reign of Zedekiah, the king of Judah.

OW it came to pass that the *ninety and first year had passed_away and it was “six
hundred years from the time that Lehi left. Jerusalem; and it: was in the year that >Lachoneus was the chief judge and the governor over the land.
2 And *Nephi, the son of Helaman, had departed out of the land of Zarahemla, giving charge unto his son.’Nephi, who was his eldest son, concerning the ‘plates of brass, and 4all_ the records-which had been kept, and.all those things which had been kept sacred from the depar- ture of Lehi out of Jerusalem.
3 Then he ‘departed out of the land, and whither he went, noman knoweth; and his son Nephi. did keep the records. in his stead, yea, the record of this people.
4 And _ it came to pass that in -the commencement of the ninety and second year, behold, the prophecies of the prophets began to be fulfilled more fully; for there began to be *ereater signs and greater miracles wrought among the people.
5 But there were some who. began to say that the time was past for the words. to be fulfilled, which were "spoken. by Samuel, the Lamanite.
6 And they began to “rejoice over their brethren, saying: Behold the time is past, and the words of Samuel are not fulfilled; therefore, your joy and your faith concerning this thing hath been vain.
7 And it came to pass that they did make a great uproar through-

| believed began to be very sorrowful, lest by any means those things
which had been spoken might not come to pass,
8 But behold, they did watch steadfastly for ‘that day and that night and that day which should be as one day as if there were no night, that they might know that their faith had not been vain.
9 Now it came to pass that there was a day set apart by the “un- believers, that all those who: be- lieved in those traditions should be *put. to. death except «the © ‘sign should come. to pass; which had been given by Samuel the prophet.
10 Now it came to_pass that when Nephi, the son of Nephi, saw this wickedness. of his people, his heart was exceedingly sorrowful.
11 And. it came to pass that he went out and bowed himself down upon the earth, and cried mightily to his God: in behalf: of his people, yea, those who were about to be destroyed because of their faith in the tradition of their fathers.
12 And it came to pass that he cried mightily unto the Lord “all that day; and behold, the °voice of the Lord came unto him, saying:

world, and to do the “will, ‘both ‘of the Father and of the Son—of the Father because of me, and of the Son because of my flesh. And behold, the time is at hand, and this night shall the sign be given.
15 And it came to pass that the words which came unto Nephi were fulfilled, according as they had been spoken; for behold, at the going down of the “sun there was °’no darkness; and the people began to be astonished because there was no darkness when the night came.
16 And there were many, who had not believed the words of the proph- ets, who “fell to the earth and became as if they were dead, for they knew that the great "plan of destruction which they had laid for those who believed in the words of the prophets had been frustrated ; for the sign which had been given was already at hand.
17 And they began to know that the Son of God must shortly appear; yea, in fine, all the people upon the face of the whole earth from the *west to the east, both in the land north and in the land south, were so exceedingly astonished that they fell to the earth.
18 For they knew that the proph- ets had testified of these things for many years, and that the sign which had been given was already at hand; and they began to fear because of their iniquity and their unbelief.
19 And it came to pass that there was no darkness in all that night, but it was as light as though it was mid-day. Andit came to pass that the sun did rise in the morning again, according to its proper order; and they knew that it was the day that the Lord should be “born, because of the ’sign which had been given.

22 And it came to pass that from | this time forth there began to be | yings sent forth among the people, | by Satan, to harden their hearts, to | the intent that they might not believe in those “signs and wonders | which they had seen; but notwith- || standing these lyings and deceivings | the ‘more part of the people did | believe, and were converted unto |

went forth among the people, and
also many others, baptizing unto repentance, in the which there was a great “remission of sins. And thus the people began again to have peace in the land.
24 And there were no contentions, save it were a few that began to preach, endeavoring to prove by the “scriptures that it was no more expedient to observe the law of Moses. Now in this thing they did err, having not understood the scriptures.
25 But it came to pass that they soon became converted, and were convinced of the error which they were in, for it was made known unto them that the law was not yet “fulfilled, and that it must be ful- filled in every whit; yea, the word came unto them that it must be fulfilled; yea, that one jot or tittle should not pass away tillit should all

year did pass away, bringing “glad tidings unto the people because of the signs which did come to pass, according to the words of the prophecy of all the holy prophets.
27 And it came to pass that the ninety and third year did also pass away in peace, save-it-were for the Gadianton robbers, who dwelt upon the ‘mountains, who did infest the land; for so strong were their holds and their secret places that the people could not overpower them; therefore they did commit many murders, and did do much slaughter among the people.
28 And it came to pass that in the ninety and fourth year they began to increase in a great degree, because there were many dissenters of the Nephites who did flee unto them, which did cause much sorrow unto those Nephites who. did: remain in the land.
29 And there was also a cause of much sorrow among the Laman- ites; for behold, they had many children who did grow up and began to wax strong in years, that they became for themselves, and were "led away by some who. were >Zoramites, by their lyings and their flattering words, to join those Gadianton robbers.
30 And thus were the Lamanites afflicted also, and began to decrease as to their faith and righteousness, because of the wickedness of the “rising generation.

Wickedness and abominations increase among the people—The Nephites and Lamanites unite to defend themselves against the Gadian- ton robbers—Converted Lamanites become white and are called Nephites.

passed away the ninety and fifth year also, and the people began to forget those 4signs and’ wonders which they had heard, and began to be less and less astonished at a sign
_or a wonder from heaven, inso-
much that they began to be hard in their hearts,, and blind in their minds, and began to disbelieve all which they had heard and seen—
2 “Imagining up some vain thing in their hearts, that it was wrought
_ by men and by the power of the
devil, to lead away and ’deceive the hearts of the people; and thus did Satan get possession of the hearts of the people again, insomuch that he did blind their eyes and lead them away to believe that the doctrine of Christ wasa “foolish anda vain thing.
3»And it came to pass that the people ‘began to’ wax strong in wickedness and abominations; and they did not believe that there should be any more signs or wonders given; and Satan did “go about, leading away the hearts of the people, tempting them and causing them that they should do great wickedness in the land.
4 And thus did pass away the ninety and sixth year; and also the ninety and seventh year; and also the ninety and eighth year; and also the ninety and ninth year;
5 And also an hundred years had passed away since the days of *Mosiah, who was king over the people of the Nephites.
6 And six hundred and nine years had passed away since Lehi left Jerusalem.
7 And nine years had passed away from the time when the sign was given, which was spoken of by the prophets, that Christ should come into the world.
8 Now the Nephites began to “reckon their time from this period

3 NEPHI 2:9-3:1
when the sign was given, or from the coming of Christ; therefore, nine years had passed away.
9 And Nephi, who was the father of Nephi, who had the charge of the records, “did not-return to the land of Zarahemla, and could nowhere be found in all the land.
10 And it came to pass that the people did still “remain in wicked- ness, notwithstanding the much preaching and prophesying which was sent among them; and thus passed away the tenth year also; and the eleventh year also passed away ininiquity.
11 And it came: to pass in the thirteenth year there began to be wars and contentions throughout all the land ; for the ?Gadianton rob- bers had become:so *numerous, and did slay so many of the people, and did lay waste so many cities, and did spread. so much death and carnage throughout the land, that it became expedient that» all the people, both the Nephites and the Lamanites, should take up arms against them.
12 Therefore, all the Lamanites who had become converted unto the Lord did unite with their brethren, the: Nephites, and were compelled, for the ‘safety of their lives and their women and their children, to take up arms against those Gadianton robbers, yea, and also to maintain their rights, and the privileges of their church and of their worship, and their freedom and their “liberty.
13 And it came to pass that before this thirteenth year had passed away the Nephites were threatened with utter destruction because of this war, which had become exceed- ingly sore.
14 And it came to pass that those Lamanites who had united with the Nephites were numbered among the Nephites ;
410
15-And their “curse was taken from them, and their skin became white like unto the Nephites;
16 And their young men and their daughters became exceedingly fair, and they were numbered among the Nephites, and were called Ne- phites. And thus ended the thir- teenth year.
17 And it came to pass in the com- mencement of the fourteenth year, the war between the robbers and the people of Nephi did continue and did become exceedingly sore; nevertheless, the people of Nephi did gain some advantage of the robbers, insomuch that they did drive them back out of their lands into the mountains and into their secret places.
18 And thus ended the fourteenth year. And in the *fifteenth year they did come forth against the people of Nephi; and because of the wicked- ness of the people of Nephi, and their many contentions and dis- sensions, the Gadianton robbers did gain many advantages over them.
19 And thus ended the fifteenth year, and thus were the people ina state of many afflictions; and the *sword of destruction did hang over them, insomuch that’ they were about to be smitten down by it, and this because of their iniquity.
CHAPTER 3
Giddianhi, the Gadianton_ leader, demands that Lachoneus and the Nephites surrender themselves and their lands—Lachoneus appoints Gid- giddoni. as chief captain of the armies—The Nephites assemble in Zarahemla and Bountiful to defend themselves.
AND now it came to pass that in the sixteenth year from the coming of Christ, “Lachoneus, the governor of the land, received an epistle from

the leader and the governor of this band of robbers; and these were the words which were written, saying:
2 Lachoneus, most noble and chief governor of the land, behold, I write this epistle unto you;<and do give unto you exceedingly great praise because of your firmness, and also the firmness of your people, in *maintaining that: which ye suppose to be your right and liberty; yea, ye do stand well, as if ye were sup- ported by the hand of a god, in the defence of your liberty, and your property, and your country, or that which ye do callso.
3 And it seemeth a pity unto me, most noble Lachoneus, that ye should be so foolish and vain:as to suppose that ye can stand against so many brave men who are at my command, who do now at this time stand in their arms, and do await with great anxiety for the word— Go down upon the Nephites and “destroy them.
4 And I, knowing of their uncon- querable spirit, having proved them in the field of battle,and knowing of their everlasting hatred towards you because of the many wrongs which ye have done unto them, therefore if they should come down against you they would visit you with utter destruction.
5 Therefore I have written this epistle, sealing it with mine own hand, feeling for your welfare, because of your firmness in that which ye believe to be right, and your noble spirit in the field of battle.
6. Therefore I) write unto you, desiring that ye would yield up unto this my people, your cities, your lands, and your possessions, rather than that they should visit you with the sword and that destruction should come upon you.
7 Or in other words, yield your-
selves up unto us, and unite with us and become. acquainted with our “secret works, and become our - brethren that ye may be like unto us-—not our slaves, but our brethren and partners of all our substance.
8 And behold, I “swear unto you, if ye will do this, with an oath, ye shall not be destroyed; but. if ye will not do this, I swear unto you with an oath, that on the morrow month I will command that my armies shall come down. against you, and they shall not stay their hand and shall spare not, but shall slay you, and shall let fall the sword upon you even until ye shall become extinct.
9 And: behold, I am “Giddianhi; and I am the governor of this the »secret society of Gadianton; which society and the works thereof I know to be ‘good; and they are of fZancient date and they have been handed down unto us.
10 And I write this epistle unto you, Lachoneus, and I hope that ye will deliver up your lands and your possessions, without the shedding of blood, that this my people may recover their rights and “govern- ment, who have dissented away from you because of your wicked- ness in retaining from them their rights of government, and except ye do this, I will avenge their wrongs. Iam Giddianhi.
11 And now it came to pass when Lachoneus received this epistle he was exceedingly astonished, be- cause of the boldness of Giddianhi demanding the possession of the land of the Nephites, and also of threatening the people and avenging the wrongs of those that had re- ceived no wrong, save it were they had “wronged themselves by dis- senting away unto those wicked and abominable robbers.

the governor, was a just man, and could not be frightened by the de- mands and the threatenings of a “robber; therefore he did not hearken to the epistle of Giddianhi, the governor of the robbers, but he did cause that his people should cry unto the Lord for °strength against the time that the robbers should come down against them.
13. Yea, he sent a proclamation among all the people, that they should “gather together their women, and their children, their flocks and their herds, and all their substance, save it were their land, unto one place:
14 And he caused that “fortifica- tions should be built round about them, and the strength thereof should be exceedingly great. And he caused that armies, both of the Nephites and of the Lamanites, or of all them who were numbered among the Nephites, should be placed as guards round about to watch them, and to guard them from the robbers day and night.
15 Yea, he said unto them: As the Lord liveth, except ye repent of all your iniquities, and cry unto the Lord, ye will in nowise be ‘delivered out of the hands of those Gadianton robbers.
16 And so great and marvelous were the words and prophecies of Lachoneus that they did cause fear to come upon all the people; and they did exert themselves in their might to do according to the words of Lachoneus.
17 And it came to pass that Lachoneus did appoint chief cap- tains over all the armies of the Ne- phites, to command them at the time that the robbers should come down out of the wilderness against them.

18 Now the chiefest among all the |; chief captains and the great com- mander of all the armies of the Nephites was appointed, and his name was “Gidgiddoni.
19 Now it was the custom among all the Nephites to appoint for their chief captains, (save it were in their times of wickedness) some one that had the ‘spirit of revelation and also prophecy; therefore, this Gidgid- doni was a great prophet among them, as also was the chief judge.
20 Now the people said unto Gidgiddoni: “Pray unto the Lord, and let us go up upon the mountains and into the wilderness, that we may fall upon the robbers and destroy them in their own lands.
21 But Gidgiddoni saith unto them: The Lord “forbid; for if we should go up against them the Lord would °deliver us into their hands; therefore we will prepare ourselves in the center of our lands, and we will gather all our armies together, and we will not go against them, but we will wait till they shall come against us; therefore as the Lord liveth, if we do this he will deliver them into our hands.
22 And it came to pass in the *seventeenth year, in the latter end of the year, the proclamation of Lachoneus had gone forth through- out all the face of the land, and they had taken their “horses, and their chariots, and their cattle, and all their flocks, and their herds, and their grain, and all their substance, and did march forth by thousands and by tens of thousands, until they had. all gone forth to the place which ‘had been appointed that they should gather themselves to- gether, to defend themselves against their enemies.

pointed was the land of Zarahemla, and the land which was between the land Zarahemla and the land *Bountiful, yea, to thetine which was between the ‘land Bountiful and the land Desolation.
24 And there were a great many thousand people who were called Nephites, who did gather them- selves together in this land. Now Lachoneus did cause that they should gather themselves together in the land “southward, because of the great curse which was upon the ‘land northward.
25 And they did fortify themselves against their enemies; and they did dwell in one land, and in one body, and they did fear the words which had been spoken by Lachoneus, insomuch that they did repent of all their sins; and they did put up their “prayers unto the Lord their God, that he would deliver them in the time that their enemies should come down against them to battle.
26 And they were exceedingly sorrowful because of their enemies. And Gidgiddoni did cause that they should make “weapons of war of every kind, and they should be strong with armor, and with shields, and with bucklers, after the manner of his instruction.
CHAPTER 4
The Nephite armies defeat the Gadian- ton robbers—Giddianhi is slain, and his successor, Zemnarihah, is hanged —The Nephites praise the Lord for their victories.
AND it came to pass that in the latter end of the eighteenth year those armies of “robbers had pre- pared for battle, and began to come down and to sally forth from the hills, and out of the mountains, and

the wilderness, and their strong- holds, and their ’secret places, and
‘began to take possession of the
lands, both which were in the land south and which were in the land north, and began to take possession of all the lands which had been ‘deserted’ by the Nephites, and the cities which had been left deso- late.
2 But behold, there were no wild beasts nor “game in those lands which had been deserted by the Nephites, and there was no game for the robbers save it were in the wilderness.
3 And the robbers could not exist save it were in the wilderness, for the want of food; for the Nephites had left their lands desolate, and had gathered their flocks and their herds and all their substance, and they werein one body.
4 Therefore, there was no chance for the robbers to plunder and to obtain food, save it were to come up in open battle against the Nephites; and the Nephites being in one body, and having so great a number, and having reserved for themselves pro- visions, and “horses and cattle, and flocks of every kind, that they might subsist for the space of "seven years, in the which time they did hope to destroy the robbers from off the face of the land; and thus the eighteenth year did pass away.
5 And it came to pass that in the nineteenth year Giddianhi found that it was expedient that he should go up to battle against the Nephites, for there was “no way that they could subsist save it were to plunder and rob and murder.
6 And they durst not spread them- selves upon the face of the land in- somuch that they could raise grain, lest the Nephites should come upon

them and slay them; ‘therefore Giddianhi gave commandment unto his armies that in this year they should go up to battle against the Nephites.
7 And it came to pass that they did come up to battle; and it was in the sixth month; and behold, great and terrible was the day that they did come up to battle; and they were
girded about after the manner of
robbers; and they had a lamb-skin about their loins, and they were dyed in blood, and their heads were shorn, and they: had headplates upon them; and great and terrible was the appearance of the armies of Giddianhi, because of their armor, and because of their being dyed in blood.
8 And it came to pass that the armies of the Nephites, when they
saw the appearance of the army of
Giddianhi, had all fallen to the earth, and did lift their cries to the Lord their God, that he would spare them and deliver them out of the hands of their enemies.
9 And it came to pass that when the armies of Giddianhi saw this they began to shout with a loud voice, because of their joy, for they had supposed that the Nephites had fallen with fear because of the terror of their armies.
10 But in this thing they were dis- appointed, for the Nephites did not °fear them; but they did fear their God and did supplicate him for *protection; therefore, when the armies of Giddianhi did rush upon them they were prepared to meet them; yea, in the strength of the Lord they did receive them.
11.And the battle commenced in this the sixth month; and great and terrible was the battle thereof, yea, great and terrible was the “slaughter thereof, insomuch that there never was known so great a slaughter among all the people of Lehi since he left Jerusalem.

12 And notwithstanding the ||) *threatenings and the oaths which ||) Giddianhi had made, behold, the |) Nephites did beat them, insomuch that they did fall back from before them.
13 And it came to pass that 2Gidgiddoni commanded that his armies should pursue them as far as the borders of the wilderness, and that they should not spare any that should fall into their hands by the way; and thus they did pursue them and did slay them, to the borders of the wilderness, even until they had fulfilled the commandment of Gid- giddoni.
14 And it came to pass that Gid- dianhi, who had stood and fought with boldness, was pursued as he fled; and being weary because of his much fighting he was overtaken and slain. And thus was the end of Giddianhi the robber.
15 And it came to pass that the armies of the Nephites did return again to their place of security. And it came to pass that this nineteenth year did pass away, and the rob- bers did not come again to battle; neither did they come again in the twentieth year.
16 And in the *twenty and first year they did not come up to battle, but they came up on all sides to lay siege round about the people of Nephi; for they did suppose that if they should cut off the people of Nephi from their “lands, and should hem them in on every side, and if they should cut them off from all their outward privileges, that they could cause them to yield themselves up according to their wishes.
17 Now they had appointed unto themselves another leader, whose name was Zemnarihah; therefore it was Zemnarihah that did cause that this siege should take place.
18 But behold, this was an advan- tage to the Nephites; for it was impossible for the robbers to lay
16a 3 Ne. 3: 23.
[*a.D, 21]
415
siege sufficiently long to. have any effect upon the Nephites, because of their ¢much ’provision. which they had laidupinstore, *~
19 And because of the scantiness of provisions among the robbers; for behold, they had nothing save it were meat for. their subsistence, which meat they did obtain in the wilderness;
20 And it came to pass that the *wild game became scarce in the wilderness insomuch that the -rob- bers were about to perish with hunger.
21 And the Nephites were contin- ually marching out by day and by night, and falling upon their armies, and cutting them off by thousands and by tens of thousands.
22 And thus it became the desire of the people of Zemnarihah to withdraw from their design, because of the great destruction which came upon them by night and by day.
23 And it came to pass that Zemnarihah did give command unto his people that they should with- draw themselves from the siege; and march into the furthermost parts of the land northward.
24 And now, Gidgiddoni being aware of their design, and knowing of their weakness because of the want of food, and the great slaughter which had been made among them, therefore he did send out his armies in the night-time, and did cut off the way of their retreat, and did place his armies in the way of their retreat.
25 And this did they do in the night-time, and got on their march beyond. the robbers, so that on the morrow, when the robbers began their march, they were met by the armies of the Nephites both in their front and in their rear.
26 And the robbers who were on the south were also cut off-in their

places of retreat. And all these things were done by command of Gidgiddoni.
27 And there were many thousands who did yield themselves up prison- ers unto the Nephites, and the remainder of them were slain.
28 And their leader, Zemnarihah, was taken and hanged upon a tree, yea, even upon the top thereof until he was dead. And when they had hanged him until he was dead they did fell the tree to the earth, and did cry with a loud voice, saying:
29 May the’ Lord preserve his people in righteousness and in holiness of heart, that they may cause to be felled to the earth all who shall seek to slay them because of power -and_ secret combinations, even as this man hath been felled to the earth.
30 And they did rejoice and cry again with one voice, saying: May the °?God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, pro- tect this people in righteousness, so long as they shall ’call on the name of their God for ‘protection.
31 And it came to pass that they did break forth, allas one, in singing, and “praising their God for the great thing which he had done for them, in preserving them from falling into the hands of their enemies.
32 Yea, they did cry: Hosanna to the Most High God. And they did cry: Blessed be the name of the Lord God ’Almighty, the Most High God.
33 And their hearts were swollen with joy, unto the gushing out of many tears, because of the great goodness of God in delivering them out of the hands of their enemies; and they knew. it was because of their repentance and their humility that they had been delivered from an everlasting destruction.

CHAPTER 5
The Nephites repent and forsake their sins—Mormon writes the history of his people and declares the everlasting word to them—Israel shall be gathered in from her long dispersion.
AND now behold, there was not a living soul among all the people of the Nephites who did “doubt in the least the words of all the holy prophets who had spoken; for they knew that it must needs be that they must be fulfilled.
2 And they knew that it must be expedient that Christ had come, because of the many signs which had been given, according to the words of the prophets; and because of the things which had come to pass already they knew that it must needs be that all things should come to pass according to that which had been spoken.
3 Therefore they did forsake all their sins, and their abominations, and their whoredoms, and did serve God with all diligence day and night.
4 And now it came to pass that when they had taken all the rob- bers prisoners, insomuch that none did escape who were not slain, they did cast their prisoners into prison, and did cause the word of God to be preached unto them; and as many as would repent of their sins and “enter into a ’covenant that they would murder no more were set at ‘liberty.
5 But as many as there were who did not enter into a covenant, and who did still continue to have those “secret murders in their hearts, yea, as many as were found breathing out threatenings against their breth- ren were condemned and punished according to the law.
6 And thus they did put an end to
416
all those wicked, and secret, and abominable combinations, in the which there was so much wicked- ness, and so many murders com- mitted.
7 And thus had the “twenty and second year passed away, and the twenty and third year also, and the twenty and fourth, and the twenty and fifth; and thus had *twenty and five years passed away.
8 And there had many things transpired which, in the eyes of some, would be great and marvel- ous; nevertheless, they cannot all be written in this book; yea, this book cannot contain even a “hun- dredth part of what was done among so many people in the space of twenty and five years;
9 But behold there are “records which do contain °all the proceed- ings of this people; and a ‘shorter but true account was given by Nephi.
10 Therefore I have made my “record of these things according to the record of Nephi, which was engraven on the plates which were called the "plates of Nephi.
11 And behold, I do make the record on plates which I have made with mine own hands.
12 And behold, I am called “Mormon, being called after the ‘land of Mormon, the land in which Alma did establish the church among the people, yea, the first church which was established among them after their transgression.
13 Behold, I am a disciple of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. I have been "called of him to declare his word among his people, that they might have everlasting life.

gone hence, who were the holy ones, should be fulfilled according to their faith, should make a “record of these things which have béénm done—
15 Yea, a *small record of that which hath taken place from the time that Lehi left Jerusalem, even down until the present time.
16 Therefore I do make my record from the accounts which have been given by those who were before me, until the commencement of my day;
17 And then I do make a “record of the things which I have seen with mine own eyes.
18 And I know the record which I make to be a just and a true record; nevertheless there are many things which, according to our “language, we are not able to write.
19 And now I make an end of my saying, which is of myself, and pro- ceed to give my account of the things which have been before me.
20 I am Mormon, and a pure “descendant of Lehi. I have reason to bless my God and my Savior Jesus Christ, that he brought our fathers out of the land of Jerusalem, (and °’no one knew it save it were himself and those whom he brought out of that land) and that he hath given me and my people so much knowledge unto the salvation of our souls.
21 Surely he hath “blessed the house of ’Jacob, and hath been ‘merciful unto the seed of Joseph.
22 And “insomuch as the children of Lehi have. kept his command- ments he hath blessed them and prospered them .according to his word.
3 NEPHI 5:15-6:1
23. Yea, and surely shall he again bring a “remnant of the seed of Joseph to the "knowledge of the Lord their God.
24 And as surely as the Lord liveth, will he “gather in from the four quarters of the earth all the rem- nant of the ’seed of Jacob, who are scattered abroad upon all the face of the earth.
25 And as he. hath “covenanted with all the house of Jacob, even so shall the covenant wherewith he hath covenanted with the house of Jacob be fulfilled in his own due time, unto the “restoring all the house of Jacob unto the knowledge of. the covenant that he hath covenanted with them.
26 And then shall they “know their Redeemer, who is Jesus Christ, the Son of God; and then shall they be gathered in from the four quarters of the earth unto their own lands, from whence they have been dis- persed; yea, as the Lord liveth so shallit be. Amen.

things whatsoever did belong unto them.
2 And it came to pass that they had “not eaten up all their pro- visions ; therefore they did take with them all that they had not devoured, of all their grain of every kind, and their gold, and their silver, and all their precious things, and they. did return to their own lands and their possessions, both on the north and on the south, both on the land northward and on the land south- ward.
3 And they granted unto those robbers who had “entered into a covenant to keep the peace of the land, who were desirous to remain Lamanites, lands, according to their numbers, that they might have, with their labors, wherewith to subsist upon; and thus they did establish peace in all the land.
4 And they began again to prosper and to wax great; and the twenty and sixth and seventh years passed away, and there was great “order in the land; and they had formed their laws according to equity and justice.
5 And now there was nothing in all the land to hinder the people from prospering continually, except they should fallinto transgression.
6 And now it was “Gidgiddoni, and the judge, °Lachoneus, and those who had been appointed leaders, who had established this great peace in the land.
7 And it came to pass that there were many cities built anew, and there were many old cities repaired.
8 And there were many “highways cast up, and many roads made, which led from city to city, and from land to land, and from place to place.
418
9 And thus passed away the twenty and eighth year, and the people had continual peace.
10 But it came to pass in the twenty and ninth year there began to be some disputings among the people; and some were lifted up unto pride and “boastings because of their exceedingly great riches, yea, even unto great persecutions ;
11 For there were many “mer- chants in the land, and also many >lawyers, and many officers.
12 And the people began to be dis- tinguished by ranks, according to their “riches and their chances for learning; yea, some were "ignorant because of their poverty, and others did receive great ‘learning because of their riches.
13 Some were lifted up in pride, and others were exceedingly hum- ble; some did return railing for railing, while others would receive railing and “persecution and all manner of °afflictions, and would not turn and ‘revile again, but were humble and penitent before God.
14 And thus there became a great inequality in all the land, insomuch that the church began to be broken up; yea, insomuch that in the thirtieth year the church was broken up in all the land save it were among a few of the Lamanites who were converted unto the true faith; and “they would not depart from it, for they were firm, and steadfast, and immovable, willing with all diligence to keep the command- ments of the Lord.
15 Now the cause of this iniquity of the people was this—*Satan had great ‘power, unto the stirring up of the people to do all manner of iniquity, and to the puffing them up

with pride, tempting them to seek for power, and authority, and ‘riches, and the vain things of the world.
16 And thus Satan,;did lead away the hearts of the people to do all manner of iniquity; therefore they had enjoyed peace but a few years.
17 And thus, in the commence- ment of the thirtieth year—the people having been “delivered up for the space of a long time to be carried about by the "temptations of the devil whithersoever he desired to carry them, and to do whatsoever iniquity he desired they should— and thus in the commencement of this, the thirtieth year, they were in a state of awful wickedness.
18. Now they did not sin “igno- rantly, for they knew the will of God concerning them, forit had been taught unto them; therefore they did wilfully ‘rebel against God.
19 And now it was in the days of Lachoneus, the son of *“Lachoneus, for Lachoneus did fill the seat of his father and did govern the people that year.
20 And there began to be men “inspired from heaven and sent forth, standing among the people in all the land, preaching and_testi- fying boldly of the sins and iniquities of the people, and testifying. unto them concerning the redemption which the Lord would make for his people, or in other words, the resurrection of Christ; and they did testify boldly of his ’death and sufferings.
21 Now there were many of the people who were exceedingly angry because of those who testified of these things; and those who were angry were chiefly the chief judges, and they who “had been high priests and lawyers; yea, all those who were
3 NEPHI 6:16-28
lawyers were angry with those who testified of these things.
22 Now there was no lawyer nor judge nor high priest that could have power to condemn any one to death save their condemnation was signed by the governor of the land.
23 Now there were many of those *who testified of the things per- taining to Christ who testified boldly, who were taken and put to death "secretly by the judges, that the knowledge of their death came not unto the governor of the land until after their death.
24 Now behold, this was con- trary to the laws of the land, that any man should be put to death except they had power from the governor of the land—
25 Therefore a complaint came up unto the land of Zarahemla, to the governor of the land, against these judges who had condemned the prophets of the Lord unto ¢death, not according to the law.
26 Now it came to pass that they were taken and brought up before the judge, to be judged of the crime which they had.done, according to the “law which had been given by the people.
27 Now it came to pass that those judges had many friends and kin- dreds; and the remainder, yea, even almost all the lawyers and the high priests, did gather themselves to- gether, and unite with the kindreds of those judges who were to be tried according to the law.
28 And they did enter into a “covenant one with another, yea, even into that covenant which was given by them of old, which cove- nant was given and administered by the ’devil, to combine against. all righteousness.

29 Therefore they did combine against the people of the Lord, and enter into a covenant to destroy them, and to deliver those who were guilty of murder from the grasp of justice, which was about to be administered according to the law.
30 And they did set at defiance the law and the rights of their country ; and they did covenant one with another to destroy the governor, and to establish a “king over the land, that the land should no more be at "liberty but should be subject unto kings.
CHAPTER <7
The chief judge is murdered, the government is overthrown, and the people divide into tribes—Jacob, an antichrist, becomes king of a league of tribes—Nephi preaches repentance and faith in Christ—Angels minister to him daily, and he raises -his brother from the dead—Many repent and are baptized.
Now behold, I will show unto you that they did not establish a king over the land; but in this same year, yea, the thirtieth year, they did destroy upon the judgment-seat, yea, did murder the chief judge of the land.
2 And the people were divided one against another; and they did “separate one from another into tribes, every man according to his family and his kindred and friends; and thus they did destroy the government of the land.
3 And every tribe did appoint a chief or a leader over them; and thus they became tribes and leaders of tribes.
4 Now behold, there was no man among them save he had much family and many kindreds and friends; therefore their tribes be- came exceedingly great.

5 Now all this was done, and there were no wars as yet among them; and all this iniquity had come upon the people “because they did "yield themselves unto the power of Satan.
6 And the regulations of the government were destroyed, be- cause of the “secret combination of the friends and kindreds of those who murdered the prophets.
7 And they did cause a great con- tention in the land, insomuch that the more righteous part of the people had nearly all become wicked; yea, there were but few righteous men among them.
8 And thus six years had not passed away since the more part of the people had turned from their righteousness, like the dog to his “vomit, or like the sow to her wallow- ing in the mire.
9 Now this secret combination, which had brought so great iniquity upon the people, did gather them- selves together, and did place at their head a man whom they did call Jacob;
10 And they did call him their king; therefore he became a king over this wicked band; and he was one of the chiefest who had given his voice against the prophets who testified of Jesus.
11 And it came to pass that they were not so strong in number as the tribes of the people, who were united together save it were their leaders did establish their laws, every one according to his tribe; nevertheless they were enemies; notwithstanding they were not a righteous people, yet they were united in the hatred of those who had entered into a covenant to “destroy the government.
12 Therefore, Jacob seeing that their enemies were more numerous than they, he being the king of the band, therefore he commanded his
8a Prov. 26: 11; 2 Pet. 2322 lla 3 Ne. 9:9,
[A.D. 29-—30]
421
people that they. should take their flight into the northernmost part of the land, and there build up unto themselves a “kingdom, until they were joined by dissenters, (for he flattered them that there would be many dissenters) and they. become sufficiently strong to: contend with the tribes of the péople; and they did so.
13 And so speedy was their march that it could not be impeded until they had gone forth out of the reach of the people. And thus ended the thirtieth year; and thus were the affairs of the people of Nephi.
14 And it came to passin the thirty and first year that they were di- vided into tribes, every man accord- ing to his family, kindred and friends; nevertheless they had come to an agreement that they would not go to war one with another; but they’ were not united as to their laws, and their manner of govern- ment, for they were established according to the minds of those who were their chiefs and their leaders. But they did establish very- strict laws that one tribe should not tres- pass against another, insomuch that in some degree they had peace in the land; nevertheless, their hearts were turned from the Lord their God, and they did stone the “prophets and did cast them out from among them.
15 And it came to pass that “Nephi—having been visited by angels and also the voice of the Lord, therefore having seen angels, and being eye-witness, and having had power given unto him that he might know concerning the minis- try of Christ, and also being eye- witness to their quick return from righteousness unto their wickedness and abominations;

16 Therefore, being “grieved for the hardness of their hearts and the blindness of their minds—went forth among them in that same year, and began to testify, boldly, re- pentance and remission of sins through faith on the Lord Jesus Christ.
17 And he did minister many things unto them; and all of them cannot be written, and a part of them would not suffice, therefore they are not written in this book. And Nephi did minister with “power and with great authority.
18 And it came to pass that they were angry with him, even because he had greater power than they, for it were “not possible that they could disbelieve his words, for so great was his faith on the Lord Jesus Christ that angels did minister unto him daily.
19 And in the name of Jesus did he cast out devils and “unclean spirits; and even his ’brother did he ‘raise from the dead, after he had been stoned and suffered death by the people.
20 And the people saw it, and did witness of it, and were angry with him. because of his power; and. he did also do “many more miracles, in the sight of the people, in the name of Jesus.
21 And it. came to. pass that the thirty and first year did pass away, and there were but few who were converted unto the Lord; but as many as were converted did truly signify unto the people that they had been “visited by the power and °Spirit of God, which was in Jesus Christ, in whom they believed.
22 And. as many as had devils cast out from them, and were “healed of their sicknesses and their infirmi- ties, did truly manifest unto the

people that they had been wrought upon by the Spirit of God, and had been healed; and. they did show forth signs also and did do some miracles among the people.
23 Thus passed away the thirty and second year also. And Nephi did cry unto the people in the com- mencement of the thirty and third year; and he did preach unto them repentance and remission of sins.
24 Now I would have you to remember also, that there were none who were brought unto 7repent- ance who were not baptized: with water.
25 Therefore, there were ordained of Nephi, men unto this ministry, that all such as should come unto them should be “baptized with water, and this as a witness and a testimony before God, and unto the people, that they had-repented and received a "remission of their sins.
26 And there were many in the commencement of this year that were baptized unto repentance; and thus the more part of the year did pass away.
CHAPTER 8
Tempests, earthquakes, fires, whirl- winds, and physical upheavals attest the crucifixion of Christ—Many people are destroyed—Darkness cov- ers the land for three days—Those who remain bemoan their fate.
AND now. it came to pass that according to our record, and we know our record to be “true, for behold, it was a °just man who did keep the record—for he truly did ‘many “miracles in the ‘name of
422
Jesus; and there was not any man who could do a miracle in the name of Jesus save he were cleansed every whit from his iniquity—
2 And now it came to pass, if there was no mistake made by this man in the reckoning of our time, the “thirty and third year had passed away;
3 And the people began to look with great earnestness for the sign which had been given by the prophet Samuel, the Lamanite, yea, for the time that there should be "darkness for the space of three days over the face of the land.
4 And there began to be great *doubtings and °disputations among the people, notwithstanding so many signs had been given.
5 And it came to pass in the *thirty and fourth year, in the first month, on the fourth day of the month, there arose a great ’storm, such an one as never had been known in all the land.
6 And there was also a great and terrible tempest; and there was terrible “thunder, insomuch that it did "shake the whole earth as if it was about to divide asunder.
7 And there were exceedingly sharp lightnings, such as never had been known in all the land.
8 And the “city of Zarahemla did take fire.
9 And the city of *Moroni did ’sink into the depths of the sea, and the inhabitants thereof were drowned.
10 And the earth was carried up upon the city of *Moronihah, that in the place of the city there be- came a great ‘mountain.

11_And there was a great and terrible destruction,.in* the land southward. iG 2)
12 But behold, there was a more great and terrible destruction in the land northward; for behold, the “whole face of the land was changed, because. of the témpest and the whirlwinds, and the thunderings and the lightnings, and the exceed- ingly great quaking of the whole earth;
13 And the “highways were broken up, and the level roads were spoiled, and many smooth places became rough.
14. And many “great and notable cities were "sunk, and many were ‘burned, and many were shaken till the buildings thereof had fallen to the earth, and the inhabitants thereof were slain, and the places were left desolate.
15. And there were some cities which remained; but the damage thereof was exceedingly great, and there were many in them who were slain.
16 And there were some who were carried away in the ?whirlwind; and whither they went no man knoweth, save they know that they were carried away.
17 And thus the face of the whole earth became deformed, because of the tempests, and the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the quaking of the earth.
18 And_behold, the rocks were rent in twain; they were broken up upon the face of the whole earth, inso- much that they were. “found: in broken fragments, and in seams and in cracks, upon all the face of the land.
19 And it came to pass that when the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the storm, and the tempest, and the quakings of the earth did cease—

for behold, they did last for about the space of “three "hours; and it was said by some that the time was greater; nevertheless, all these great and terrible things were done in about the space of three’ hours— and then behold, there was ‘dark- ness upon the face of the land.
20 And it came to pass that there was thick darkness upon all the face of the land, insomuch that the inhabitants thereof who had not fallen could “feel the °vapor of darkness ;
21 And there could be no light, because of the darkness, neither candles, neither torches; neither could there be fire kindled with their fine and exceedingly dry wood, so that there could not be any light atall;
22 And there was not any light seen, neither fire, nor glimmer, neither the sun, nor the moon, nor the stars, for so great were the mists of darkness which were upon the face of the land.
23 And it came to pass that it did last for the space of three days that there was no light seen; and there was great mourning and “howling and weeping among all the people continually; yea, great were the groanings of the people, because of the darkness and the great destruc- tion which had come upon them.
24 And in one place they were heard to cry, saying: O that we had repented “before this great and terrible day, and then would our brethren have been spared, and they would not have been "burned in that great city Zarahemla.
25 And in another place they were heard to’cry and mourn, saying: O that we had repented before this great and terrible day, and had not killed and stoned the prophets, and cast them out; then. would. our

CHAPTER 9
In the darkness the voice of Christ proclaims the destruction of many people and cities for their wickedness —He also proclaims his divinity, an- nounces that the law of Moses is fulfilled, and invites men to come unto himand be saved.
AND it came to pass that there was a “voice heard among all the in- habitants of the earth, upon all the face of this land, crying:
2 Wo, wo, wo unto this people; wounto the inhabitants of the whole earth except they shall “repent; for the devil "laugheth, and his angels rejoice, because of the slain of the fair sons and daughters of my people; and it is because of their iniquity and abominations that they are fallen!
3 Behold, that great city. Zara- hemla have I “burned with fire, and the inhabitants thereof.
4 And behold, that great city Moroni have I caused to be “sunk in the depths of the sea, and the inhabitants thereof to be drowned.
5 And behold, that great city “Moronihah have I covered with earth, and the inhabitants thereof, to hide their iniquities and their abominations from before my face, that the blood of the prophets and the saints shall not come any more unto me against them.
6 And behold, the city of Gilgal
have I caused to be sunk, and the inhabitants thereof to be buried up in the depths of the earth;
7 Yea, and the city of Onihah and the inhabitants thereof, and the city of Mocum and the inhabitants thereof, and the city of “Jerusalem and the inhabitants thereof; and bwaters have I caused to come up in the stead thereof, to hide their wickedness and abominations from before my face, that the ‘blood of the prophets and the saints shall 4not come up any more unto me against them.
8 And behold, the city of Gadiandi, and the city of Gadiomnah, and the city of Jacob, and the city of Gim- gimno, all these have I caused to be sunk, and made fhills and valleys in the places thereof; and the inhabi- tants thereof have I °buried up in the depths of the earth, to hide their wickedness and abominations from before my face, that the blood of the prophets and the saints should not come up any more unto me against them.
9 And behold, that great city Jacobugath, which was inhabited by the people of king Jacob, have I caused to be burned with fire because of their sins and their 4wickedness, which was above all the wickedness of the whole earth, because of their ’secret murders and combinations; for it was they that did ‘destroy the peace of my people and the government of the land; therefore I did cause them to be burned, to ¢destroy them from before my face, that the blood of the prophets and thesaints should not come up unto me any more against them.

10 And behold, the city of Laman, and the city of Josh, and.the city of Gad, and the city of “Kishkumen, have I caused to be burned with fire, and the inhabitants thereof, be- cause of their wickedness in casting out the prophets, and stoning those whom I did send to declare unto them. concerning their wickedness and their abominations.
11 And because they did cast them all out, that there were none righteous among them, I did send down “fire and destroy them, that their wickedness and abominations might be hid from before my °face, that the blood-of the prophets and the saints whom I sent among them might not cry unto me ‘from the ground against them.
12 And “many great destructions have I caused to come upon this land, and upon this people, because of their wickedness and. their abominations.
13 Oall ye that are “spared because ye were more "righteous than they, will ye not now return unto me, and repent of your sins, and be. con- verted, that I may ‘heal you?

And whoso cometh unto me with a broken heart and a con- trite spirit, him will I "baptize with fireand with the Holy Ghost, evenas the Lamanites, because of their faith in meat the time of their conversion, were baptized with fire and with the Holy Ghost, and they knew it not.

CHAPTER 10
There is silence in the land for many hours—The voice of Christ promises to gather his people as a hen gathereth her chickens—The more righteous part of the people had been preserved.
AND now behold, it came to pass that all the people of the land did *hear these sayings, and did witness of it. And after these sayings there was silence in the land for the space of many hours;
2. For so great was the astonish- ment of the people that they did cease lamenting and howling for the loss of their kindred which had been slain; therefore there was silence in all the land for the space of many hours.
3 And it came to pass that there came a voice again unto the people, and all the people did hear, and did witness of it, saying:
4 O ye people of these “great cities which have fallen, who are descen- dants of Jacob, yea, who are of the house of Israel, how oft have I bgathered you as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and have ‘nourished you.
5 And again, how oft would I have gathered you as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, yea, O "ve people of the house of Israel, who have fallen; yea, O ye people
426
of the house of Israel, ye that dwell at Jerusalem, as ye that have fallen; yea, how oft would I have gathered you as a hen gathereth her chickens, and ye would not.
6O ye house of Israel whom I have *¢spared, how oft will I gather you as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, if ye will repent and return. unto me with full purpose of ‘heart.
7 But if not, O house of Israel, the places of your dwellings shall be- come “desolate until the time of the fulfilling of the "covenant to your fathers.
8 And now it came to pass that after the people had heard these words, behold, they began to weep and howl “again because of the loss of their kindred and friends.
9 And it came to pass that thus did the three days pass away. And it was in the morning, and the *dark- ness dispersed from off the face of the land, and the earth did cease to tremble, and the ’rocks did cease to rend, and the dreadful groanings did cease, and all the tumultuous noises did pass away.
10 And the earth did cleave to- gether again, that it stood; and the “mourning, and the weeping, and the wailing of the people who were spared alive did cease; and their mourning was turned into joy, and their lamentations into the "praise and thanksgiving unto the Lord Jesus Christ, their Redeemer.
11 And thus far were the @scrip- tures fulfilled which had been spoken by the prophets.

13 And they were spared and were not sunk and buried up in the earth; and they were not drowned in the depths of the sea; and they were not burned by fire, neither were they fallen upon and crushed to death; and they were not carried away in the whirlwind; neither were they overpowered by the vapor of smoke and of darkness.
14 And now, whoso readeth, let him understand; he that hath the scriptures, let him “search them, and see and behold if all these deaths and destructions by fire, and by smoke, and by °tempests, and by whirlwinds, and by the ‘opening of the earth to receive them, and all these things are not unto the fulfilling of the prophecies of many of the holy prophets.
15 Behold, I say unto you, Yea, many have testified of these things at the coming of Christ, and were 4slain because they testified of these things.
16 Yea, the prophet *Zenos did testify of these things, and also Zenock spake concerning these things, because they testified par- ticularly concerning us, who are the remnant of their seed.
17 Behold, our father Jacob also testified concerning a “remnant of the seed of Joseph. And behold, are not we a remnant of the seed of Joseph? And these things which testify of us, are they not written upon the plates of brass which our father Lehi brought out of Jeru- salem?

spared, and also those who had been called. *Lamanites, who had been spared, did have great favors shown unto them, and great °blessings poured out upon their heads, inso- much that soon after the ‘ascension of Christ into heaven he did truly manifest himself unto them—
19 “Showing his body unto them, and ministering unto them; and an account of his ministry shall be given hereafter. Therefore for this time I make an end of my sayings.
Jesus Christ did show himself unto the people of Nephi, as the multitude were gathered together in the land Bountiful, and did minister unto them; and on this wise did he show himself unto them. Comprising chap- ters 11 to 26 inclusive.
CHAPTER 11
The Father testifies of his Beloved Son—Christ appears and proclaims his atonement—The people feel the wound marks in his hands and feet and side—They cry Hosanna—He sets forth the mode and manner of baptism—The spirit of contention is of the devil—Christ’s doctrine is that men should believe and be baptized and receive the Holy Ghost.
AND now it came to pass that there were a great multitude “gathered together, of the people of Nephi, round about the temple which was in the land "Bountiful; and they were marveling and wondering one with another, and were showing one to another the ‘great and marvelous change which had taken place.
2 And they were also conversing about this Jesus Christ, of whom the "sign had been given concerning his death.

3 And it came to pass that while they were thus conversing one with another, they heard a “voice as if it came out of heaven; and they cast their eyes round about, for they understood not the voice which they heard; and it was not a harsh voice, neither was it a loud voice; never- theless, and notwithstanding it being a ’small voice it did “pierce them that did hear to the center, insomuch that there was no part of their frame that it did not cause to quake; yea, it did pierce them to the very soul, and did cause their hearts to burn.
4 And it came to pass that again they heard the voice, and they “understood it not.
5 And again the third time they did hear the voice, and did “open their ears to hear it; and their eyes were towards the sound thereof; and they did look steadfastly to- wards heaven, from whence the sound came.
6 And behold, the third time they did understand the voice which they heard; and it said unto them:
7 Behold my “Beloved Son, ?in whom I am well pleased, in whom I have glorified my name—hear ye him.
8 And it came to pass, as they understood they cast their eyes up again towards heaven; and behold, they “saw a Man “descending out of heaven; and he was clothed in a white robe; and he came down and stood in the midst of them; and the eyes of the whole multitude were turned upon him, and they durst

not open their mouths, even one to another, and wist not what it meant, for they thought it was an angel that had appeared unto them.
9 And it came to pass that he stretched forth his hand and spake unto the people, saying:
10 Behold, I am Jesus Christ, whom the prophets testified shall come into the world. 5
11 And behold, I am the “light and the life of the world; and I have drunk out of that bitter °cup which the Father hath given me, and have glorified the Father in ‘taking upon me the sins of the world, in the which I have suffered the ¢will of the Father in all things from the beginning.
12 And it came to pass that when Jesus had spoken these words the whole multitude “fell to the earth; for they remembered that it had been ’prophesied among them that Christ should ‘show himself unto them after his ascension into heaven.
13 And it came to pass that the “Lord spake unto them saying:
14 Arise and come forth unto me, that ye may “thrust your hands into my side, and also that ye may feel the prints of the nails in my hands and in my feet, that ye may know that I am the °God of Israel, and the God of the whole earth, and have been slain for the sins of the world.

was he, of whom it was written by ©
the prophets, that should come.
16 And when they had all gone forth and had witnessed for them- selves, they did cry out with one accord, saying:
17 Hosanna! Blessed be the name of the Most High God! And they did fall down at the feet of Jesus, and did ‘worship him.
18 And it came to pass that he spake unto “Nephi (for Nephi was among the multitude) and he com- manded him that he should come forth.
19 And Nephi arose and. went forth, and *bowed himself before the Lord and did "kiss his feet.
20 And the Lord commanded him that he should “arise. And he arose and stood before him.
21 And the Lord said unto him: I give unto you “power that ye shall ‘baptize this people when I am again ascended into heaven.
22 And again the Lord called “others, and said unto them like- wise; and he gave unto them power to baptize. And he said unto them: On this wise shall ye baptize; and there shall be °no. disputations among you.
23 Verily I say unto you, that whoso repenteth of his sins through your “words, and ’desireth to be
3 NEPHI 11:16-30

shall ye baptize them—Behold, ye shall go down and ‘stand in the water, and in my name shall ye baptize them.
24 And now behold, these are the words which ye shall: say, calling them by name, saying:
25 Having “authority given me of Jesus Christ, I baptize you in the name of the ?Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.
26 And then shall: ye “immerse them in the water, and come forth again out of the water.
27 And after this manner shall ye “baptize in my name; for behold, verily I say unto you, that the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost are "one; and I am in the Father, and the Father in me, and the Father and I are one.
28 And according as I have com- manded you thus shall ye baptize. And there shall be no “disputations among you, as there have hitherto been; neither shall there be dispu- tations among you concerning the points of my doctrine, as there have hitherto been.
29 For verily, verily I say unto you, he that hath the spirit of ¢con- tention is not of me, but is of the ’devil, who is the father of conten- tion, and he stirreth up the hearts of men to contend with anger, one with another.

36 And thus will the Father bear record of me, and the *Holy Ghost will bear record unto him of the Father and me; for the Father, and I, and the Holy Ghost are ’one.

CHAPTER 13
Jesus teaches the Nephites the Lord’s Prayer—They are to lay up treasures in heaven—The Twelve in their ministry are commanded to take no thought for temporal things—Com- pare Matthew 6.
“VERILY, verily, I say that I would that ye should do alms unto the poor; but take heed that ye do not your alms before men to be seen of them; otherwise ye have no reward of your Father who is in heaven.
2 Therefore, when ye shall do your alms do not sound a trumpet before you, as will hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have “glory of men. Verily I‘say unto you, they have their reward.
3 But when thou doest alms let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth;
4 That thine alms may bein secret; and thy Father who seeth in secret, himself shall reward thee openly.

17 But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thy head, and ¢wash thy face;
18 That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father, who is in “secret; and thy Father, whoseeth in secret, shall reward thee openly,
19 Lay not up for ‘yourselves treasures upon earth, where “moth and rust doth corrupt, and thieves break through and steal;
20 But lay up for yourselves "treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal.
21 For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.
22 The “light of the body is the beye; if, therefore, thine eye be ‘single, thy whole body shall be full of light.
23 But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If, therefore, the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness !
24 No man can “serve "two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will hold to the one and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and Mammon.
25 And now it came to pass that when Jesus had spoken these words he looked upon the ‘twelve whom he had chosen, and said unto them: Remember the words which I have spoken. For behold, ye are they whom I have chosen to minister unto this people. Therefore I say unto you, ‘take no thought for your
they love to pray, standing in the synagogues and-in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, they have their reward.
6 But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast “shut thy door, pray to thy Father who is in secret; and thy Father, who °seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.
7 But when ye pray, use not ?vain repetitions, as the "heathen, for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.
8 Be not ye therefore like unto them, for your Father “knoweth what things ye have need of before ye °ask him.
9 After this *manner therefore *pray ye: Our ‘Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
10 Thy will be done on earth as it isin heaven.
11 And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.
12 And “lead us not into tempta- tion, but deliver us from evil.
13 For thineis the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, forever. Amen.
14 For, if ye *forgive men their trespasses your heavenly . Father will also forgive you;
15 But if ye forgive not men their trespasses neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.
16 Moreover, when ye “fast be not as the “hypocrites, of a sad counte- nance, for they disfigure their faces that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto-you, they have their reward.

26 Behold the “fowls of the air, for they sow not, neither do they reap nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are yenot much better than they?
27 Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature?
28 And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the “lilies of the field how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin;
29 And yet I say unto you, that even Solomon, in all his glory, was not arrayed like one of these.
30 Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which today is, and tomorrow is cast into the oven, even so will he clothe you, if ye are not of little faith.
31 Therefore take no thought, say- ing, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?
32 For your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.
33 But ‘seek ye first the "kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto
you. 34 Take therefore no thought for the morrow, for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. *Sufficient is the day unto the evil thereof. CHAPTER 14
Jesus commands: Judge not; ask of God; beware of false prophets— He promises salvation to those who do the will of the Father—Compare Matthew 7.
“AND now it came to pass that when
3.NEPHI 13:26-14:12
Jesus had spoken these words he
turned again to the multitude, and did open his mouth unto them again, saying: Verily, verily, I say unto you, Judge not, that ye be not judged.
2 *For with what judgment: ye judge, ye shall be judged; and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.
3 And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother’s eye, but considerest not the beam that isin thine own eye?
4 Or how wilt thou say to thy brother: Let me pull the mote out of thine eye—and behold, a beam is in thineowneye?
5 Thou “hypocrite, first cast the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast the mote out of thy brother’s eye.
6 Give not that which is “holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you.
7 “Ask, and it shall be given unto you; "seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.
8 For every one that asketh, re- ceiveth; and he that seeketh, find- eth; and to him that knocketh, it shall be opened.
9 Or what manis there of you, who, if his son ask bread, will give hima stone?
10 Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent?
11 If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father who is in heaven give good things to them that ask him?
12 Therefore, all things whatso- ever ye would that men should do to you, “do ye even so to them, for this is the law and the prophets.

13 Enter ye in at the “strait gate; for wide is the gate, and °broad is the way, which leadeth to destruc- tion, and many there be who go in thereat;
14 Because strait is the “gate, and ‘narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and ‘few there be that find it.
15 Beware of “false prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.

Jesus directs the people to ponder his words and pray for understanding— He heals their sick—He prays for the people, using language that cannot be written— Angels minister to and fire encircles their little ones.
BEHOLD, now it came to pass that when Jesus had spoken these words he looked round about again on the multitude, and he said unto them: Behold, my “time is at hand.
2 I “perceive that ye are weak, that ye cannot °understand all my words which I am commanded of the Father to speak unto you at this time.
3 Therefore, go ye unto your homes, and “ponder upon the things which I have said, and ask of the Father, in my name, that ye may

4 But now I “go unto the Father, and also to "show myself unto the lost tribes of Israel, for they are not ‘lost unto the Father, for he knoweth whither he hath taken them.
5 And it came to pass that when Jesus had thus spoken, he cast his eyes round about again on the multitude, and beheld they were “in tears, and did look steadfastly upon him as if they would ask him to tarry alittle longer with them.
6 And he said unto them: Behold, my bowels are filled with “compas- sion towards you.
7 Have ye any that are “sick among you? Bring them hither. Have ye any that are lame, or blind, or halt, or maimed, or "leprous, or that are withered, or that are deaf, or that are afflicted in any manner? Bring them hither and I will ‘heal them, for I have compassion upon you; my bowels are filled with mercy.
8 For I perceive that ye desire that I should show unto you what I have done unto your brethren at Jeru- salem, for I see that your “faith is ’sufficient that I should heal you.
9 And it came to pass that when he had thus spoken, all the multitude, with one accord, did go forth with their sick and their afflicted, and their lame, and with their“blind, and with their dumb, and with all them that were afflicted in any manner; and he did heal them every one
as they were brought forth unto him.

10 And they did all, both they who had been healed and’they who were whole, bow down at his feet, and did worship him; and as many as could come for the multitude did “kiss his feet, insomuch that they did bathe his feet with their tears.
11 And it came to pass that he commanded that their “little chil- dren should be brought.
12 So they brought their little children and set them down upon the ground round about him, and Jesus stood in the midst; and the multitude gave way till they had.all been brought unto him.
13 And it came to pass that when they had all been brought, and Jesus stood in the midst, he commanded the multitude that they should “kneel down upon the ground.
14 And it came to pass that when they had knelt upon the ground, Jesus groaned within himself, and said: Father, Iam “troubled because of the wickedness of the people of the house of Israel.
15 And when he had said these words, he himself also “knelt upon the earth; and behold he "prayed unto the Father, and the things which he prayed cannot be written, and the multitude did bear record who heard him.
16 And after this manner do they bear record: The “eye hath never seen, neither hath the ear heard, before, so great and marvelous things as we saw and heard Jesus speak unto the Father;

18 And it came to pass that when Jesus had made’an end of praying unto the Father, he arose; but so great was the “joy of the multitude that they were overcome.
19 And it came to pass that Jesus spake unto them, and bade them arise.
20 And they arose from the earth, and he said unto them: Blessed are ye because of your faith. And “now behold, my joy is full.
21 And when he had said these words, ‘he “wept, and the multi- tude bare record of it, and he took their little children, one by one, and ’blessed them, and prayed unto the Father for them.
22 And when he had done this he wept again;
23 And he spake unto the multi- tude, and said unto them: Behold your little ones.
24 And as they looked to_behold they cast their eyes towards heaven, and they saw the heavens open, and they saw angels descending out of heaven as it were in the midst of fire; and they came down and “encircled those little ones about, and they were encircled about with fire; and the angels did minister unto them.
25 And the multitude did see and “hear and bear record; and they know that their-record is true for they all of them did see and hear, every: man for himself; and they were in number about two thousand and five hundred souls; and they did consist of:-men; women, «and children.

CHAPTER 18
Jesus institutes the sacrament among the Nephites—They are commanded to pray always in his name—Those who eat his flesh and drink his blood unworthily are damned—The. dis- ciples are given power to confer the Holy Ghost.
AND it came to pass that Jesus commanded his disciples that they should bring forth some “bread and wine unto him.
2 And while they were gone for bread and wine, he commanded the multitude that they should sit themselves down upon the earth.
3 And when the disciples had come with “bread and wine, he took of the bread and brake and blessed it ; and he gave unto the disciples and com- manded that they shouldeat. —
4 And when they had eaten and were filled, he commanded that they should give unto the multitude.
5 And when the multitude had eaten and were filled, he said unto the disciples: Behold there shall one be “ordained among you, and to him will I give power that he shall *break ‘bread and bless it and give it unto the. people of my 4church, unto all those who shall believe and be baptized in my name.
6 And this shall ye always observe to “do, even as I have done, even as I have broken bread and blessed it and given it unto you.
7 And this shall ye do in “remem- brance of my "body, which I have shown. unto you. And it shall be a testimony unto the Father that ye do always remember me. And if ye do always remember me ye shall have my Spirit to be with you.
8 And it came to pass that when he
said these words, he commanded his disciples that they should take of the *wine of the cup and drink of it, and that they should also give unto the multitude that they might drink of it.
9 And it came to pass that they did so, and did drink of it and were filled; and they gave unto the multi- tude, and they did drink, and they were filled.
10 And when the disciples had done this, Jesus said unto them: Blessed are ye for this thing which ye have done, for this is fulfilling my com- mandments, and this doth witness unto the Father that ye are ?willing to do that which I have com- manded you.
11 And this shall ye always do to those who repent and are baptized in my name; and ye shall do it in *remembrance of my "blood, which I have shed for you, that ye may witness unto the Father that ye do always remember me. And if ye do always remember me ye shall have my Spirit to be with you.
12 And I give unto you a com- mandment that ye shall do these things. And if ye shall always do these things blessed are ye, for ye are built upon my “rock.
13 But whoso among you shall do *more or less than these are not built upon my rock, but are built upon a sandy foundation; and when the rain descends, and the floods come, and the winds blow, and beat upon them, they shall fall, and the ‘gates of hell are ready open to receive them.
14 Therefore blessed are ye if ye shall keep my _ commandments, which the Father hath commanded me that I should give unto you.

15 Verily, verily, I say unto you, ye must watch and*“pray.always, lest ye be tempted by the devil, and ye be led away captive by him.
16 And as I have prayed. among you even so shall ye pray in. my “church, among my. people who do repent and are baptized in my name. Behold I am the “light; I have set an ‘example for you.
17 And it came to pass that when Jesus had spoken these words unto his disciples, he turned again unto the multitude and said unto them:
18 Behold, verily, verily, I say unto you, ye must watch and pray always lest ye enter into tempta- tion; for *Satan desireth to have you, that he may sift you as wheat.
19 Therefore ye must always pray unto the Father inmy name;
20 And “whatsoever yeshallaskthe Father in my name, which is right, believing that ye shall receive, be- hold it shall be given unto you.
21 °Pray in your families unto the Father, always. in my name, that your wives and your children may be blessed.
22 And. behold, ye shall “meet together oft; and ye shall not forbid any man from .coming unto you when ye shall meet together, but suffer them that. they may. come unto you and forbid them not;
23 But ye shall “pray for them, and shall not cast them out; and if it so be that they come unto you oft ye shall pray for them unto the Father, in my name. -
24 Therefore, hold up your “light
3 NEPHI 18:15-30
‘that it may shine unto the world.
Behold I am the Plight which ye shall hold up—that which ye have seen me do. Behold ye see.that I have prayed unto the Father, and ye.allhave witnessed.
25 And ye see that I have com- manded that “none of you should go away, but rather have commanded that ye should come unto me, that ye might "feel and see;.even so shall ye do unto the world; and whoso- ever breaketh this commandment suffereth himself to be led into temptation.
26 And now. it came to pass that when. Jesus had spoken these words, he turned his eyes. again upon the “disciples whom he had chosen, and said unto them:
27 Behold verily, verily, I say unto you, I give unto. you another com- mandment, and then I must go unto my “Father that I may fulfil other commandments whichhe hath given me.
28 And now behold, this is the commandment which I give unto you, that ye shall not suffer any one knowingly to “partake of my flesh and blood °unworthily, when ye shallministerit;
29 For whoso eateth and drinketh my flesh and “blood °unworthily eateth.and drinketh,damnation to his soul; therefore if ye know that.a man is unworthy to eat.and drink of my flesh and blood ye shall forbid him.

31 But if he repent not he shall not be numbered among my people, that he may not destroy my people, for behold I “know °my sheep, and they are numbered.
32 Nevertheless, ye shall not cast him out of your “synagogues, or your places of worship, for unto such shall ye continue to minister; for ye know not but what they will return and repent, and come unto me with full purpose of heart, and I shall °heal them; and ye shall be the means of bringing salvation unto them.
33 Therefore, keep these sayings which I have commanded you that ye come not under “condemnation; for wo unto him whom the Father condemneth.

35 And now I go unto the Father, because it is expedient that I should go unto the Father “for your sakes.
36 And it came to pass that when Jesus had made an end of these sayings, he touched with his “hand the °disciples whom he had chosen, one by one, even until he had touched them all, and spake unto them as he touched them.
37 And the multitude heard not the words which he spake, therefore they did not bear record; but the disciples bare record that he gave them “power to give the Holy

38 And it came to pass that when Jesus had touched them all, there came a “cloud and overshadowed the multitude that they could not see Jesus.
39 And while they were over- shadowed he “departed from them, and ascended into heaven. And the disciples saw and did bear record that he ascended again into heaven.
CHAPTER 19
The Twelve Disciples minister unto the people and pray for the Holy Ghost—They are baptized and re- ceive the Holy Ghost and the minister- ing of angels—Jesus prays using words that cannot be written—He attests to the exceedingly great faith of these Nephites.
AND now it came to pass that when Jesus had ascended into heaven, the multitude did disperse, and every man did take his wife and his chil- dren and did return to his own home.
2 And it was noised abroad among the people immediately, before it was yet dark, that the multitude had seen Jesus, and that he had minis- tered unto them, and that he would also show himself on the “morrow unto the multitude.
3 Yea, and even all the night it was noised abroad concerning Jesus; and insomuch did they send forth unto the people that there were many, yea, an exceedingly great number, did labor exceedingly all that night, that they might be on the morrow in the place where Jesus should show himself unto the multitude.

4 And it came to pass that on the morrow, when the miiltitude was gathered together, behold, Nephi and his “brother whom he. had raised from the °dead, whose name was Timothy, and also~his son, whose name was Jonas, and also Mathoni, and Mathonihah, his brother, and Kumen, and Kumen- onhi, and Jeremiah, and Shemnon, and Jonas, and Zedekiah, and Isaiah—now these were the names of the ¢disciples whom Jesus had chosen—and it came to pass that they went forth and stood in the midst of the multitude.
5 And behold, the multitude was *so great that they did cause that they should be separated into twelve bodies.
6 And the twelve did teach the multitude; and behold, they did cause that the multitude should *kneel down upon the face of the earth, and should pray unto the Fatherin the name of Jesus.
7 And the disciples did pray unto the Father alsoin the name of Jesus. And it came to pass that they arose and ministered unto the people.
8 And when. they had ministered those same words which Jesus had spoken—nothing varying from the words which Jesus had spoken— behold, they knelt again and prayed to the Father in the name of Jesus.
9 And they did pray for that which they most desired; and they desired that the “Holy Ghost should be given unto them.
10 And when they had thus prayed they went down unto the water’s edge, and the multitude followed them.
11 And it came to pass that Nephi went down “into the water and was >baptized.

baptized all those whom Jesus had chosen.
13 And it came to pass when they were all baptized and had come “up out of the water, the "Holy Ghost did fall upon them, and they were filled with the Holy Ghost and with fire.
14: And behold, they were “en- circled about as if it were by fire; and it came down from heaven, and the multitude did witness it, and did bear record; and angels did come down out of heaven and did minister unto them.
15 And it came to pass that while the angels were ministering unto the disciples, behold, Jesus came and stood in the midst and ministered unto them.
16 And it came to pass that he spake unto the multitude, and com- manded them that they should kneel down again upon the earth, and also that his disciples should kneel down upon the earth.
17 And it came to pass that when they had all knelt down upon the earth, he commanded his disciples that they should pray.
18 And behold, they began to pray; and they did pray unto Jesus, calling him their Lord and their God.
19 And it came to pass that Jesus departed out of the midst of them, and went a little way off from them and *bowed himself to the earth, and he said:
20 Father, I thank thee that thou hast given the Holy Ghost unto these whom I have “chosen; and it is because of their belief in me that I have chosen them out of the world.

23 And now Father, I *pray unto thee for them, and also for all those who shall believe on their words, that they may believe in me, that I may be in them °’as thou, Father, artinme, that we may be “one.
24 And it came to pass that when Jesus had thus prayed unto the Father, he came unto his disciples, and behold, they did still continue, without ceasing, to pray unto him; and they did not “multiply many words, for it was given unto them what they should “pray, and they were filled with desire:
25 And it came to pass that Jesus blessed them as they did pray un- to him; and his ¢countenance did smile upon them, and the light of his >countenance did “shine upon them, and behold they were as “white as the countenance and also the gar- ments of Jesus;  and-»behold the whiteness thereof did exceed all the whiteness, yea, even there could be nothing upon earth so white as the whiteness thereof.
26 And Jesus said unto them: Pray on; nevertheless they did not cease to pray.
27 And he turned from them again, and went a little way off and bowed himself to the earth; and he prayed again unto the Father, saying:
28 Father, I thank thee that thou hast “purified those whom I have chosen, because of their faith, and I
446
pray for them, and also for them who shall believe on their words, that they may be purified in me, through faith on their words, even as they are purified in me.
29 Father, I pray not for the world, but for those whom thou hast given me “out of the world, because of their faith, that they may be puri- fied in me, that I may be in them as thou, Father, art in me, that we may be one, that I may be glorified in them.
30 And when Jesus had spoken these words he came again unto his disciples; and behold they did pray steadfastly, without ceasing, unto him; and he did smile upon them again; and behold they were “white, evenas Jesus.
31 And it came to pass that he went again a little way off and prayed unto the Father;
32 And tongue cannot speak the words which he prayed, neither can be “written by man the words which he prayed.
33 And the multitude did hear and do bear record; and their “hearts were open. and they did understand in their hearts the words which he prayed.
34 Nevertheless, so great and mar- velous. were the words which he prayed that they cannot be written, neither can they be “uttered by man.
35 And it came to pass that when Jesus had made an end of praying he came again to the disciples, and said unto them: “So great °faith have I never seen among all. the Jews; wherefore I could not show unto them so great ‘miracles, be- cause of their ?unbelief.

CHAPTER 20
Jesus provides bread and wine mi- raculously and again administers the sacrament unto them—The remnant of Jacob shall come to.the knowledge of the Lord their God and shall inherit the Americas— Jesus is the prophet like unto Moses, and the Nephites are children of the prophets—Others of the Lord’s people shall be gathered to Jerusalem.
AND it came to pass that he com- manded the multitude that they should “cease to "pray, and also his disciples. And he commanded them that they should not cease to pray in their hearts.
2 And he commanded them that they should arise and stand up upon their feet. And they arose up and stood upon their feet.
3 And it came to pass that he “brake “bread again and blessed it, and gave to the disciples to eat.
4 And when they had eaten he commanded them that they should break bread, and give unto the multitude.
5 And when they had given unto the multitude he also gave them wine to drink, and commanded them that they should give unto the multitude.
6 Now, there had been no “bread, neither wine, brought by the
disciples, neither by the multitude; 7 But he truly “gave unto them bread to eat, and also wine to drink.
3 NEPHI 19:36—20:15
8 And he said unto them: He that eateth this bread eateth of “my body to his soul; and he that drinketh of this wine drinketh of my blood to his soul; and his soul shall never hunger nor thirst, but shall be filled.
9 Now, when the multitude had all eaten and drunk, behold, they were filled with the Spirit; and they did cry out with one voice, and gave glory to Jesus, whom they both saw and heard.
10 And it came to pass that when they had all given glory unto Jesus, he said unto them: Behold now I finish the commandment which the Father hath commanded me con- cerning this people, who are a rem- nant of the house of Israel.

43 Behold, my servant shall deal prudently; he shall be exalted and extolled and be very high.
44 As many were astonished at thee—his visage was so marred, more than any man, and his form more than the sons of men—
45 So shall he “sprinkle many nations; the kings shall shut their mouths at him, for that which had not been told them shall they see; and that which they had not heard shall they °consider.
46 Verily, verily, I say unto you, all. these things shall surely come, even as the Father hath com- manded me.

CHAPTER 21
Israel shall be gathered when the Book of Mormon comes forth—The Gentiles shall be established as a free people in America—They shall be saved if they believe and obey; otherwise they shall be cut off and destroyed—Israel shall build the New Jerusalem, and the lost tribes shall return.
AND verily I say unto you, I give unto you a “sign, that ye may know the ’time when these things shall be about to take place—that I shall gather in, from their long dispersion, my people, O house of Israel, and
450
shall establish again among them my Zion;
2 And behold, this is the thing which] will giveuntoyou fora sign— for verily I say unto you that *when these things which I declare unto you, and which I shall declare unto you hereafter of myself, and by the power of the Holy Ghost which shall be given unto you of the Father, shall be made known unto the Gentiles that they may know concerning this people who are a remnant of the house of Jacob, and concerning this my people who shall be scattered by them;
3 Verily, verily, I say unto you, when these things shall be made *known unto them of the Father, and shall come forth of the Father, >from them unto you;
4 For it is wisdom in the Father that they should be established in this land, and be set up as a “free
‘people by the power of the Father,
that these things might come forth from them unto a remnant of your seed, that the ’covenant of the Father may be fulfilled which he hath covenanted with his people, O house of Israel;
5 Therefore, when these works and the works which shall be wrought among you hereafter shall come forth “from the Gentiles, unto your
seed which shall dwindle in un- |
belief because of iniquity ;

8 And when that day shall come, it shall come to pass that kings shall shut their mouths; for that which had not been told them shall they see; and that which they had not heard shall they “consider.

11 Therefore it shall come to pass that whosoever will not believe in my words, who am Jesus Christ, which the Father shall cause “him to bring forth unto the °Gentiles, and shall give unto him power that he shali bring them forth unto the Gentiles, (it shall be done even as Moses said) they shall be ‘cut off

13 Their hand shall be lifted up upon their “adversaries, and all their enemies shall be cut off.
14 Yea, wo be unto the Gentiles except they “repent; for it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Father, that I will cut off thy horses out of the midst of thee, and I will destroy thy chariots;
15 And I will cut off the cities of thy land, and throw down all thy “strongholds;
16 And I will cut. off ¢‘witchcrafts out of thy land, and thou-shalt have no more soothsayers;

“therefore it must needs be that he must speak also to the Gentiles.
3 And all things that he spake have been and “shall be, even according to the words which he spake.
4 Therefore give heed to my words; write the things which I have told you; and according to the time and the will of the Father “they shall go forth unto the Gentiles.
5 And whosoever will hearken unto my words and repenteth and is baptized, the same shall be saved. Search the “prophets, for many there be that testify of these things.
6 And now it came to pass that when Jesus had said these words he said unto them again, after he had expounded all the scriptures unto them which they had received, he said unto them: Behold, other scriptures I would that ye should write, that ye have not.
7 And it came to pass that he said unto “Nephi: Bring forth the record which ye have kept.
8 And when Nephi had brought forth the records, and laid them before him, he cast his eyes upon them and said:
9 Verily I say unto you, I. com- manded my servant *Samuel, the Lamanite, that he should testify unto this people, that at the day that the Father should glorify his name in me'that there were ’many ‘saints who should “arise from the dead, and should appear unto many, and should minister unto them. And he said unto them: Was it not so?
10 And his disciples answered him and said: Yea, Lord, Samuel did prophesy according to thy words, and they were all fulfilled.
11 And Jesus said unto them: How

be it that ye have not “written this thing, that many “saints did arise and appear unto many and did minister unto them?
12 And it came to pass that Nephi remembered that this thing had not been written.
13 And it came to pass that Jesus commanded that it should be ¢writ- ten; therefore it was written accord- ingas he commanded.
14 And now it came to pass that when Jesus had “expounded all the scriptures in one, which they had written, he commanded them that they should "teach the things which he had expounded unto them.
CHAPTER 24
The Lord’s messenger shall prepare the way for the Second» Coming— Christ shall sit in judgment—Israel is commanded to pay tithes and offerings—A book of remembrance is kept—Compare Malachi 3.
AND it came to pass that he com- manded them that they should write the words which the Father had given unto Malachi, which he should tell unto them. And it came to pass that after they were written he expounded them. And these are the words which he did tell unto them, saying: Thus said the Father unto Malachi—Behold, I will ¢send my ’messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me, and the Lord whom ye seek shall suddenly “come to his temple, even the “messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in; behold, he shall come, saith the Lord of Hosts.

3 And. he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver; and he _ shall “purify the ’sons of Levi, and purge them as gold-and silver, that they may ‘offer unto the Lord an offer- ing in righteousness.
4 Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto the Lord, as in the days of old, and as in former years.
5 And I will come “near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift wit- ness against the °sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against false “swearers, and against. those that “oppress the hireling in his wages, the widow and the °father- less, and that turn aside. the ‘stranger, and fear not me, saith the Lord of Hosts.
6 For *I am the Lord, I change not; therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed.

10 Bring ye all the “tithes into the

11 And I will rebuke the *?devourer for your sakes, and_he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast her fruit before the time in the fields, saith the Lord of Hosts.
12 And all nations shall call you blessed, for ye shall be a de- lightsome land, saith the Lord of Hosts.
13 Your words have been stout against me, saith the Lord. Yet ye say: What have we spoken against thee?
14 Ye have: “said: It is "vain to serve God, and what doth it profit that we have kept ‘his “ordinances and that we have walked mourn- fully before the Lord of Hosts?
15 And now we call the proud happy; yea, they that work wicked- ness are set up; yea, they that tempt God are even delivered.
16 Then they that feared the Lord “spake often one to another, and the Lord hearkened and heard; and a book of "remembrance was written before him for them that feared the Lord, and that thought upon his name.

CHAPTER 25
At the Second Coming the proud and wicked shall be burned as stubble— Elijah shall return before that great and dreadful day—Compare Malachi 4.
“For behold, the day cometh that shall "burn as an oven; and all the ‘proud, yea, and all that do wick- edly, shall be stubble; and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the Lord of Hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch.

CHAPTER 26
Jesus expounds all things from the beginning to the end—Babes and children utter marvelous things which cannot be written—Those in the Church of Christ have all things in commonamong them.
AND now it came to pass that when Jesus had told these things he ex- pounded them unto the multitude; and he did expound all things unto them, both great and small.
2 And he saith: °These scriptures, which ye had not with you, the Father commanded that I should give unto you; for it was wisdom in him that they should be given unto future generations.
3 And he did expound all things, even from the beginning until the "time that he should come in his °glory—yea, even all things which should come upon the face of the earth, even until the ‘elements should melt with fervent heat, and the earth should be ¢wrapt together as a scroll, and the heavens and the earth should pass away ;

judged of their works, whether they be good or whether’they be evil—
5 If they be good, to the “resur- rection of everlasting life; and if they be evil, to the resurrection of damnation; being on a parallel, the One on the one hand and the other on the other hand, according to, the mercy, and the justice, and the holiness which is in Christ, who was “before the world began.
6 And now there cannot be written in this book even a “hundredth part of the things which Jesus did truly teach unto the people;
7 But behold the “plates of Nephi do contain the more part of the things which he taught the people.
8 And these things have I written, which are a “lesser part of the things which he taught the people; and I have written them to the intent that they may be brought again unto this people, ’from the Gentiles, according to the words which Jesus hath spoken.
9 And when they shall have re- ceived this, which is expedient that they should have first, to try their faith, and if it shall so be that they shall believe these things then shall the “greater things be made mani- fest unto them.
10 And if it so be that they will not believe these things, then shall the “greater things be "withheld from them, unto their condemnation.
11 Behold, I was about to write them, all which were engraven upon the plates of Nephi, but the Lord *forbade it, saying: I will ’try the

12 Therefore I, *Mormon, do write the things which have been com- manded me of the Lord. And now I, "Mormon, make an end of my sayings, and proceed to write the things which have ~ been  com- manded me.
13 Therefore, I would that ye should behold that the Lord truly did teach the people, for the space of three days; and after that he did *show himself unto them oft, and did break bread oft, and bless it, and give it unto them.
14 And. it came to pass that he did teach and minister unto the ¢chil- dren of the multitude of whom hath been spoken, and he did "loose their ‘tongues, and they did speak unto their fathers great and marvelous things, even greater than he had revealed unto the people; and he loosed. their tongues that they could utter.
15 And it came to pass that after he had ascended into heaven—the second time that he showed himself unto them, and had gone unto the Father, after having “healed all their sick, and their lame, and opened the eyes of their blind and unstopped the ears of the deaf, and even had done all manner of cures among them, and raised a man from the *dead, and had shown forth his power unto them, and had ascended unto the Father—

and utter marvelous things; and the things which they did utter were ‘forbidden that there should not any man write them.
17 And it came to pass that the 2disciples whom Jesus had chosen began °from that time forth to ‘baptize and to teach as many as did come unto them; and as many as were baptized in the name of Jesus were filled with the Holy Ghost.
18 And many of them saw and heard unspeakable things, which are “not lawful to be written.
19 And they taught, and did "minister one to another; and they had ?all things ‘common among them, every man dealing justly, one with another.
20 And it came to pass that they did do all things even as Jesus had commanded them.
21 And they who were baptized in the name of Jesus were called the *¢chutch of Christ.
CHAPTER 27
Jesus commands them to call the Church in his name—His mission and atoning sacrifice constitute his gospel—Men are commanded to re- pent and be baptized that they may be sanctified by the Holy Ghost—They are tobeevenas Jesus is.
AND it came to pass that as the disciples of Jesus were journeying and were preaching the things which they had both heard and seen, and were baptizing in the name of Jesus, it came to pass that the disciples were gathered together and were %united in mighty prayer and °fasting.
2 And Jesus again “showed him- self unto them, for they were pray-
458
ing unto the Father in his name; and Jesus came and stood in the midst of them, and said unto them: What will ye that I shall give unto you?
3 And they said unto him: Lord, we will that thou wouldst tell us the "name whereby we shall call this church; for there are disputations among the people concerning this matter. ’
4 And the Lord said unto them: Verily, verily, I say unto you, why is it that the people should murmur and dispute because of this thing?
5 Have they not read the scrip- tures, which say ye must take upon you the “name of Christ, which is my name? For by this name shall ye becalled at the last day;
6 And whoso taketh upon him my name, and “endureth to the end, the same shall be saved at the last day.
7 Therefore, whatsoever ye shall do, ye shall do it in my name; there- fore ye shall call the church in my name; and ye shall call upon the Father in my name that he will bless the church for my sake.
8 And how be it *my *church save it be called in my name? For if a church be called in Moses’ name then it be Moses’ church; or if it be called in the name of a man then it be the church of aman; but ifit be called in my name then it is my church, if it so be that they are built upon my gospel.
9 Verily I say unto you, that ye are built upon my gospel; therefore ye shall call whatsoever things ye do call, in my name; therefore if ye call upon the Father, for the church, if it be in my name the Father will hear you;

11 But if-it be not built-upon my gospel, and is built upon the works of men, or upon the works of the devil, verily I say unto you they have joy in their works for a season, and by and by the end cometh, and they are “hewn: down and: cast into the °fire, from whence there is no return.
12 For their.works do “follow them, for it is because of their works that they are hewn down; therefore remember the things that 1 have told you.
13. Behold I have given unto you my “gospel, and this is the gospel which 1 have given unto you—that I came into the world to do the will of my Father, because my Father sent me.
14 And my Father sent me that I might be “lifted up upon the °cross; and after that I had»been lifted up upon the ‘cross, that I might ¢4draw all men unto me, that as I have been lifted up by men even .so should men be lifted up by the Father, to stand before me, to be ¢judged of their works, whether they be good or whether they be evil—
15 And for this cause have I been ‘lifted up; therefore, according to the power of the Father I will draw all men unto me, that they may be judged according to their °works.
16 And it shall come to pass, ‘that
3-NEPHI 27:11-21
whoso “repenteth and is baptized in my ’name shall be filled; and if he ‘endureth to the end, behold, him will I. hold guiltless before my Father at that day when I shall stand to judge the world.
17 And he that endureth not unto the end, the same is he that is also hewn down and cast into the fire, from whence they can no more return, because of the “justice of the Father.
18 And this is the word which he hath given unto the children of men. And for this cause he fulfilleth the words which he hath given, and he lieth not, but fulfilleth all-his words.
19 And ¢no unclean thing can enter into his kingdom; therefore nothing entereth into his ’rest save it’ be those who have ‘washed their gar- ments in my blood, because of their faith, and the repentance of all their sins, and their faithfulness unto the end.
20 Now this is the commandment: *Repent, all ye ends of the earth, and come unto me and be "baptized in my name, that ye may be ‘sancti- fied by the reception of the Holy Ghost, that ye may stand spotless before me at the last day.
21 Verily, verily, I say unto you, this is my °gospel; and ye know the things that ye must °do in my church; for the works which ye have seen me do that shall ye also do; for that which ye have seen me do even that shall ye do;

And in that day will I visit them, even in turning their works upon their own heads.
33 And it came to pass that when Jesus had ended these sayings he said unto his disciples: Enter ye in at the “strait gate; for strait is the gate, and narrow is the way that leads to life, and few there be that find it; but wide is the gate, and broad the way which leads to death, and many there be that travel there- in, until the night cometh, wherein no man can work.

2 And they all spake, save it were three, saying: We desire that after we have lived unto the age of man, that our ministry,. wherein thou hast called us, may have anend, that we may speedily come unto thee in thy kingdom.
3 And ‘he said unto them: Blessed are ye because ye desired this thing of me; therefore, after that ye are *seventy and two years old ye shall come unto me in my °kingdom; and with me ye shall find ‘rest.
4 And when he had spoken unto them, he turned himself unto the three, and said unto them: What will ye that I should do unto you, when I am gone unto the Father?
5 And they sorrowed in their hearts, for they durst not speak unto him the thing which they desired.
6 And he said unto them: Behold, I ¢know your thoughts, and ye have desired the thing which °John, my beloved, who was with me in my ministry, before that I was lifted up by the Jews, desired of me.
7 Therefore, more blessed are ye, for ye shall *never taste of "death; but ye shall live to behold all the doings of the Father unto the children of men, even until all things shall be fulfilled according to the will of the Father, when I shall come in my glory with the ‘powers of heaven.
8 And ye shall never endure the pains of death; but when I shall come in my glory ye shall be changed in the twinkling of an eye from

9 And again, ye shall not have pain while ye shall dwell in the flesh, neither sorrow Save it be for the @sins of the world; and all this will I do because of the thing which ye have desired of me, for ye have desired that ye might “bring the souls of men unto me, while the world shall stand.

12 And it came to pass that when Jesus had spoken these words, he touched every one of them with his finger save it were the “three who were to tarry, and then he departed.
13 And behold, the heavens were opened, and they were ‘caught up into heaven, and saw and heard un- speakable things.
14 And it was *forbidden them that they should utter; neither was it given unto them "power that they could utter the things which they saw and heard;

they were changed from this body of flesh into an immortal state, that they could behold the things of God.
16 But it came to pass that they did again minister upon the face of the earth; nevertheless they did not minister of the things which they had heard and seen, because of the commandment which was given them in heaven.
17 And now, whether they were mortal or immortal, from the day of their transfiguration, I know not;
18 But this much I know, accord- ing to the record which hath been given—they did go forth upon the face of the land, and did minister un- to all the people, uniting as many to the church as would believe in their preaching; baptizing them, and as many as were baptized did receive the Holy Ghost.
19 And they were cast into prison by them who did not belong to the church. And the “prisons could not hold them, for they were rent in twain.
20 And they were cast down into the earth; but they did smite the earth with the word of God, inso- much that by his “power they were delivered out of the depths of the earth; and therefore they could not dig pits sufficient to hold them.
21 And thrice they were cast into a “furnace and received no harm.
22 And twice were they cast into a *den of wild beasts; and behold they did play with the beasts as a child with a suckling lamb, and received no harm.
23 And it came to pass that thus they did go forth among all the people of Nephi, and did preach the “gospel of Christ unto all people upon the face of the land; and they were
462
converted unto the Lord, and were united unto the church of Christ, and thus the people of ’that genera- tion were blessed, according to the word of Jesus.
24 And now I, “Mormon, make an end of speaking concerning these things for a time.
25 Behold, I was about to write the “names of those who were never to taste of death, but the Lord for- bade; therefore I write them not, for they are hid from the world.
26 But behold, ?I have seen them, and they have ministered unto me.
27 And behold they will be “among the Gentiles, and the Gentiles shall know them not.
28 They will also be among the Jews, and the Jews shall know them not.
29 And it shall come to pass, when the Lord seeth fit in his wisdom that they shall minister unto all the *scattered tribes of Israel, and unto all nations, kindreds, tongues and people, and shall bring out of them unto Jesus many souls, that their desire may be fulfilled, and also because of the convincing power of God which is in them.
30 And they are as the “angels of God, and if they shall pray unto the Father in the name of Jesus they can show themselves unto whatso- ever man it seemeth them good.
31 Therefore, great and marvelous works shall be wrought by them, before the “great and coming day when all people must surely stand before the judgment-seat of Christ;
32 Yea even among the Gentiles shall there be a “great and marvelous work wrought by them, before that judgment day.

34 And wo be unto him that will ‘not hearken unto the words of Jesus, and also to them whom he hath chosen and ’sent among them; for whoso ‘receiveth not the words of Jesus and the words of those whom he hath sent receiveth not him; and therefore he will not re- ceive them at the last day;
35 And it would be better for them if they had not been born. For do ye suppose that ye can get rid of the justice of an“offended God, whohath been °trampled under feet of men, that thereby salvation might come?
36 And now behold, as I spake con- cerning those whom the Lord hath chosen, yea, even three who were caught up into the heavens, that I. knew not whether they were “cleansed from *mortality to im- mortality—
37 But behold, since I wrote, I have inquired of the Lord, and he hath made it manifest unto me that there must needs be a change wrought upon their bodies, or else it needs be that they must taste of death;
38 Therefore, that they might not taste of death there was a “change wrought upon their bodies, that they might not “suffer pain nor sorrow save it were for the sins of the world.
39 Now this change was not equal to that.which shall take place at the last day; but there was a change wrought upon them, insomuch that Satan could have no power over them, that he could not “tempt them; and they were "sanctified in the flesh, that they were ‘holy, and

that the powers of the earth could not hold them.
40 And in this state they were to remain until the judgment day of Christ; and at that day they were to receive a greater change, and to be
' received into the kingdom of the
Father to go no more out, but to dwell with God eternally in the heavens.

The coming forth of the Book of Mormon is a sign that the Lord has commenced to gather Israel and fulfill his covenants—Those who reject his latter-day revelations and gifts shall be cursed.
AND now behold, I say unto you that when the Lord shall see fit, in his wisdom, that these sayings shall %come unto the Gentiles according to his word, then ye may know that the covenant which the Father hath made with the children of Israel, concerning their restoration to the ‘lands of their inheritance, is already beginning to be fulfilled.
2 And ye may know that the words of the Lord, which have been spoken by the holy prophets, shall all be fulfilled; and ye need not say that the Lord “delays his coming unto the children of Israel.
3 And ye need not imagine in your hearts that the words which have been spoken are vain, for behold, the Lord will remember his covenant which he hath made unto his people of the house of Israel.
4 And when ye shall see these say- ings coming forth among you, then ye need not any longer spurn at the doings of the Lord, for the “sword of his °justice is in his right hand;

and behold, at that day, if ye shall spurn at his doings he will cause that it shall soon overtake you.

his works !
6 Yea, wo unto him that shall deny the revelations of the Lord, and that shall say the Lord no longer worketh by revelation, or by prophecy, or by gifts, or by tongues, or by heal- ings, or by the power of the Holy Ghost !

Christ !
8 Yea, and ye need not any longer *hiss, nor "spurn, nor make game of the “Jews, nor any of the remnant of the house of Israel; for behold, the Lord remembereth his covenant unto them, and he will do unto them according to that which he hath
sworn.

FOURTH NEPHI THE BOOK OF NEPHI
WHO IS THE SON OF NEPHI—ONE OF THE DISCIPLES OF JESUS CHRIST
An account of the people of Nephi, according to his record.
The Nephites and the Lamanites are all converted to the Church of Christ— They have all things in common, work miracles, and prosper in the land— After two centuries divisions, evils, false churches, and persecutions arise —After three hundred years both the Nephites and the Lamanites _ are wicked—Ammaron hides up the sacred records.
ND it came to pass that the thirty and fourth year passed away, and also the thirty and
fifth, and behold the disciples of Jesus had formed a church of Christ in all the lands round about. And as many as did come unto them, and did truly repent of their sins, were “baptized in the name of Jesus; and they did also receive the Holy Ghost.
2 And it came to pass in the thirty and sixth year, the people were all converted unto the Lord, upon all the face of the land, both Nephites and Lamanites, and there were no contentions and disputations among them, and every man did deal justly one with another.
3 And they had 2all things com- mon among them; therefore there were not rich and poor, bond and free, but they were all made free, and partakers of the heavenly opift.
4 And it came to pass that the thirty and seventh year passed
away also, and there still continued to be “peace in the land.
5 And there were great and mar- velous works wrought by the dis- ciples of Jesus, insomuch that they did “heal the sick, and °raise the dead, and cause the lame to walk, and the blind to receive their sight, and the deaf to hear; and all man- ner of ‘miracles did they work among the children of men; and in nothing did they work miracles save it were in the name of Jesus.
6 And thus did the thirty and eighth year pass away, and also the thirty and ninth, and forty and first, and the forty and second, yea, even until forty and: nine years had passed away, and also the fifty and first, and the fifty and second; yea, and even until fifty and nine years had passed away.
7 And the Lord did prosper them exceedingly in the land; yea, inso- much that they did build cities again where there had been cities burned.
8 Yea, even that great “city Zara- hemla did they cause to be built again.
9° But there were many cities which had been “sunk, and waters came up in the stead thereof; therefore these cities could not be renewed.
10 And now, behold, it came to pass that the people of Nephi did wax strong, and did multiply exceedingly fast, and became an exceedingly fair and delightsome people.

11 And they were married, and given in marriage, and were blessed according to the multitude of the *promises which the Lord had made unto them.
12 And they did not walk any more after the “performances and "ordi- nances of the ‘law of Moses; but they did walk after the commandments which they had received from their Lord and their God, continuing in “fasting and prayer, and in meeting together oft both to pray and to hear the word of the Lord.
13 And it came to pass that there was no contention among all the people, inallthe land; but there were mighty miracles wrought among the disciples of Jesus.
14 And it came to pass that the *seventy and first year passed away, and also the seventy and second year, yea, and in fine, till the seventy and ninth year had passed away; yea, even an hundred years had passed away, and the “disciples of Jesus, whom he had chosen, had all gone to the ’paradise of God, save it were the ‘three who should tarry; and there were other @disciples °or- dained in their stead; and also many of that ‘generation had passed away.
15 And it came to pass that there was no “contention in the land, because of the "love of God which did dwell in the hearts of the people.
16 And there were no “envyings, nor °strifes, nor “‘tumults, nor whore- doms, nor lyings, nor murders, nor any manner of “lasciviousness; and surely there could not be a “happier people among all the people who had been created by the hand of God. 17 There were no robbers, nor

murderers, neither were there Lamanites, nor any manner of -ites; but they were in “one, the children of Christ, and heirs to the kingdom of God.
18 And how blessed were they! For the Lord did bless them in all their doings; yea, even they were blessed and prospered until tan hundred and ten years had passed away; and the first generation from Christ had passed away, and there was no contention in all the land.
19 And it came to pass that 2Nephi, he that kept this last record, (and he kept it upon the "plates of Nephi) died, and his son Amos kept it in his stead; and he kept it upon the plates of Nephi also.
20 And he kept it eighty and four years, and there was still peace in the land, save it were a small part of the people who had revolted from the church and taken upon them the name of Lamanites; there- fore there began to be *Lamanites again in the land.
21 And it came to pass that 7Amos died also, (and it was an hundred and ninety and four years from the coming of Christ) and his son Amos kept the record in his stead; and he also kept it upon the plates of Nephi; and it was also written in the book of Nephi, which is this book.
22 And it came to pass that +two hundred years had passed away; and the second generation had all passed away save it were a few.
23 And now I, Mormon, would that ye should know that the people had multiplied, insomuch that they were spread upon all the face of the land,

and. that they had beceme exceed- ingly “rich, because of their prosper- ity in Christ.
24 And now, in this *two hundred and first year there began to be among them those who were lifted up in “pride, such as the wearing of costly. apparel, and all manner of fine pearls, and of the fine things of the world.
25 And from that time forth they. did have their goods and their substance no more “common among them.
26 And they began to be divided into classes; and they began to build up “churches unto themselves to get °esain, and began to deny the true church of Christ.
27 And it came to pass that when ttwo hundred and ten years. had passed. away there were many churches in the land; yea, there weremany churches which professed to know the Christ, and yet they did *deny the more parts of his gospel, insomuch that they did receive all manner. of wickedness, and did administer that which was sacred unto him to whom it had. been °for- bidden because of unworthiness.
28 And this church did multiply exceedingly because of iniquity, and because of the power of *Satan who did get hold upon their "hearts.
29 And again, there was. another church which denied the Christ; and they did “persecute the true ’church of Christ, because of their humility and their belief in Christ; and they did despise them because of the many miracles which were wrought among them.
30 Therefore they did exercise power and authority over the disciples of Jesus who did tarry with
4NEPHI 1:24-37
them, and they did cast them into *prison; but by the power of the word of God, which was in them, the prisons were rent in twain, and they went forth. doing mighty miracles among them.
31 Nevertheless, and notwith- standing all. these miracles, the people did harden their hearts, and did seek to kill them, even as the Jews at Jerusalem sought to kill Jesus, according to his word.
32 And they did cast them into “furnaces of fire, and they came forth receiving no harm.
33 And they also cast them into dens of wild beasts, and they did play with the wild beasts even as a child with a lamb; and they did come forth from. among them, receiving no harm.
34 Nevertheless, the people did harden their hearts, for they were led by many. priests. and “false prophets to. build up many churches, and to do all:manner of iniquity. And they did smite upon the people of Jesus; but the people of Jesus did not smite again. And thus they. did dwindle in unbelief and wickedness, from year to year, even until two hundred and thirty years had passed away.
35 And now it came to pass in this year, yea, in the {two hundred and thirty and first year, there was a great division among the people.
36 And it came to pass that in this year there arose a people who were called the *Nephites, and they were true believers in Christ; and among them there were those who were called by the Lamanites—Jacobites, and Josephites, and °Zoramites ;
37 Therefore the true believers in Christ, and the true worshipers of

Christ, (among whom were the “three disciples of Jesus who should tarry) were called Nephites, and Jacobites, and Josephites, and Zoramites.
38 And it came to pass that they who rejected the gospel were called Lamanites, and Lemuelites, and Ishmaelites; and they did not dwindle in “unbelief, but they did owilfully rebel against the gospel of Christ; and they did teach their children that they should not believe, even as their fathers, from the beginning, did dwindle.
39 And it was because of the wickedness and abomination of their fathers, even as it was in the begin- ning. And they were “taught to hate the children of God, even as the Lamanites were taught to "hate the children of Nephi from the beginning.
40 And it came to pass that *two hundred and forty and four years had passed away, and thus were the affairs of the people. And the “more wicked part of the people did wax strong, and became exceedingly more numerous than were the people of God.
41 And they did still continue to build up churches unto themselves, and adorn them with all manner of precious things. And thus did two hundred and fifty years pass away, and also two hundred and sixty years.
42 And it came to pass that the wicked part of the people began again to build up the secret oaths and “combinations of Gadianton.
43 And also the people who were called the people of Nephi began to be proud in their hearts, because of

their exceeding riches, and become “vain like unto their brethren, the Lamanites.
44 And from this time the disciples began to sorrow for the “sins of the | world. |
45 And it came to pass that when three hundred years had passed away, both the people of Nephi and | the Lamanites had become exceed- ingly wicked one like unto another.
46 And it came to pass that the robbers of *Gadianton did spread over all the face of the land; and there were none that were righteous save it were the disciples of Jesus. | And gold and silver did they lay up instore in abundance, and did ’traffic in all manner of traffic.
47 And it came to pass that after three hundred and five years had passed away, (and the people did still remain in wickedness) “Amos died; and his brother, Ammaron, did keep the record in his stead.
48 And it came to pass that when }$three hundred and twenty years had passed away, “Ammaron, being constrained by the Holy Ghost, did *hide up the ‘records which were 4sacred—yea, even all the sacred records which had been handed down from generation to generation, which were sacred—even until the three hundred and twentieth year from the coming of Christ.
49 And he did hide them up unto the Lord, that they might “come again unto the remnant of the house of Jacob, according to the prophecies and the promises of the Lord. And thus is the end of the record of Ammaron.

THE BOOK OF MORMON
CHAPTER 1
Ammaron instructs Mormon con- cerning the sacred records—War com- mences between the Nephites and the Lamanites—The Three Nephites.are taken away—Wickedness, unbelief, sorceries, and witchcraft prevail.
ND _ now I, Mormon, make a A "record of the things which I have both seen and heard, and
call it the "Book of Mormon.
2 And about the time that 7Am- maron hid up the records unto the Lord, he came unto me, (I being about ten years of age, and I began to be "learned somewhat after the manner of the learning of my people) and Ammaron said unto me: I perceive that thou art a ‘sober child, and art quick to observe;
3 Therefore, when ye are about twenty and four years old I would that ye should remember the things that ye have observed concerning this people; and when ye are of that age go to the “land Antum, unto a hill which shall be called "Shim; and there have I deposited unto the Lord all the sacred engravings concerning this people.
4 And behold, ye shall take the *plates of Nephi unto yourself, and the remainder shall ye leave in the place where they are; and ye shall engrave on the plates of Nephi all the things that ye have observed concerning this people.
5 And I, Mormon, being a descen- dant of “Nephi, (and my father’s name was Mormon) I remembered the things which Ammaron com- manded me.
6 And it came to pass that I, being *eleven years old, was carried by
my father into the land southward, even to the land of Zarahemla. *
7 The whole face of the land had become covered with buildings, and the people were-as numerous almost, as it were the sand of the sea.
8 And it came to pass in this year there began to be a war between the *"Nephites, who’ consisted of the Nephites and the Jacobites and the Josephites and the Zoramites; and this war was between the Nephites, and the Lamanites and the Lemuel- ites and the Ishmaelites.
9 Now the *Lamanites and the Lemuelites -and the’ Ishmaelites were called Lamanites, and the two parties were Nephites and. Laman- ites, :
10 And it came to pass that the war began to be among them in the borders of Zarahemla, by the waters of Sidon.
11 And it came to pass that the Nephites had gathered together'a great number of men, even to exceed the number of thirty thou- sand. And it came to pass that they did have in this same year a number of “battles, in which the Nephites did beat the Lamanites and did slay many of them.
12 And it came to pass that the Lamanites withdrew their design, and there was peace settled in the land; and peace did remain for the space of about four years, that there was no bloodshed.
13 But wickedness did prevail upon the face of the whole land, insomuch that the Lord did take away his “beloved disciples, and the work of miracles and of healing did cease because of the iniquity of the people. 14 And there were no “gifts from

the Lord, and the “Holy Ghost did not come upon any, because of their wickedness and ‘unbelief.
15 And I, *being fifteen years of age and being somewhat of a "sober mind, therefore I was ‘visited of the Lord, and ¢tasted and knew of the goodness of Jesus.
16 And I did endeavor to preach unto this people, but my mouth was shut, and I was forbidden that I should preach unto them ; for behold they had ¢wilfully rebelled against their God; and the beloved disciples were "taken away out of the land, because of their iniquity.
17 But I did remain among them, but I was forbidden to ?preach unto them, because of the hardness of their hearts; and because of the hardness of their hearts the land was "cursed for their sake.
18 And these. Gadianton robbers, who were among the Lamanites, did infest the land, insomuch that the inhabitants thereof began to “hide up their treasures in the earth; and they became slippery, because the Lord had cursed the land, that they could not hold them, nor retain them again.
19 And it came to pass that there were ‘sorceries, and. witchcrafts, and magics; and the power of the evil one was wrought upon all the face of the land, even unto the ful- filling of all the words of Abinadi, and also ’Samuel the Lamanite.

—Their day of grace is passed— | Mormon obtains the plates of Nephi | —Wars continue.
AND it came to pass in that same || year there began to be a war again | between the Nephites and the | Lamanites. And notwithstanding I | being “young, was large in stature; | therefore the people of Nephi | appointed me that I should be
their leader, or the leader of their | armies.
2 Therefore it came to pass that | tin my sixteenth year I did go forth at the head of an army of the Nephites, against the Lamanites; | therefore three hundred and twenty and six years had passed away.

4 And it came to pass that we did | come to the city of Angola, and we did take possession of the city, and make preparations to defend our- selves against the Lamanites. And it came to pass that we did “fortify | the city with our might; but not- withstanding all our fortifications the Lamanites did come upon us and did drive us out of the city.
5 And they did also drive us forth out of the land of David. '
6 And we marched forth and came to the land of Joshua, which was in the borders west by the seashore.

possible, that we might get them together in ?one body.
8 But behold, the land was “filled with ’robbers and with Lamanites; and ‘notwithstanding the great destruction which hung over my people, they did not repent of their evil doings; therefore there was blood and carnage spread through- out all the face of the land, both on the part of the Nephites and also on the part of the Lamanites; and it was one complete revolution throughout all the face of the land.
9 And now, the Lamanites had a king, and his name was “Aaron; and he came against us with an army of forty and four thousand. And be- hold, I withstood him with forty and two thousand. And it came to pass that’ I beat him with my army that he fled before me. And behold, all this was done, and *three hundred and thirty years had passed away. )
10 And it came to pass that the Nephites began to repent of their iniquity, and began to cry even as had been prophesied by Samuel the prophet; for behold no man could “keep that which was his own, for the thieves, and the robbers, and the murderers, and the magic art, and the witchcraft which was in the land.
11 Thus there began to be a %mourning and a lamentation in all the land because of these things, and more especially among the people of Nephi.
12 And it came to pass that when I, Mormon, saw their lamentation and their “mourning and their sorrow before the Lord, my heart did begin to rejoice within me, knowing the mercies and the long-suffering of

the Lord, therefore supposing that he would be merciful unto them that they would °’again become a righteous people.
13 But behold this my joy was vain, for their “sorrowing was not unto repentance, because of the goodness of God; but it was rather the ’sorrowing of the ‘damned, be- cause the Lord would not always suffer them to take “happiness in sin.
14 And they did not come unto Jesus with broken “hearts and contrite spirits, but they did °curse God, and wish to die. Nevertheless they would struggle with the sword for their lives.
15 And it came to pass that my sorrow did return unto me again, and I saw that the “day of grace °was passed with them, both temporally and spiritually; for I saw thousands of them hewn down in open “rebellion against their God, and heaped up as ‘dung upon the face of the land. And thus fthree hundred and forty and four years had passed away.
16 And it came to pass that in the three hundred and forty and fifth year the Nephites did begin to flee before the Lamanites; and they were pursued until they came even to the land of Jashon, before it was possible to stop them in their retreat.
17 And now, the city of Jashon was near the “land where Ammaron had ’deposited the records unto the Lord, that they might not be de- stroyed.- And: behold I had ‘gone according to the word of Ammaron, and taken the ’plates of Nephi, and did make a record according to the words of Ammaron.

did make. a full account of all the wickedness and abominations; but upon “these plates I did forbear to make a full account of their wicked- ness and abominations, for behold, a continual scene of wickedness and abominations has been before mine eyes ever since I have been sufficient to behold the ways of man.
19 And wo is me because of their wickedness; for my heart has been filled with sorrow because of their wickedness, all my days; neverthe- less, I know that shall be “lifted up at the last day.
20 And it came to pass that in this year the people of Nephi again were hunted and driven. And it came to pass that we were driven forth until we had come northward to the land which was called Shem.
21.And it came to pass that we did fortify the city of Shem, and we did gather in our people as much as it were possible, that perhaps wemight save them from destruction.
22 And it came to pass in the *three hundred and forty and sixth year they began to come upon us again.
23 And it came to pass that I did speak unto my people, and did urge them with great energy, that they would stand boldly before. the Lamanites and “fight for their owives, and their children, and their houses, and their homes.
24 And my. words did arouse them somewhat to vigor, insomuch that they did not flee from before the Lamanites, but.did stand with bold- ness.against them.
25 And it came to pass that we did contend with an army of. thirty thousand against an army of fifty thousand. And it came to pass that we did stand before them with such firmness that they did flee from before us.
26 And it came to pass that when they had fled we did pursue them
472 | with our armies, and did meet them again, and did *beat them; never- theless the °strength of the Lord was not with us; yea, we were leftto | ourselves, that the Spirit of the | Lord did not abide in us; therefore we had become weak like unto our brethren.
27 And my heart did sorrow be- cause of this the great calamity of my people, because of their wicked- ness and their abominations, But behold, we did go forth against the Lamanites and the robbers. of Gadianton, until we had again taken possession of the lands of our inheritance.
28 And the fthree hundred and forty and ninth year had passed away. And in the three hundred and fiftieth year we made a treaty with the Lamanites and the robbers of Gadianton, in which we did get the ‘lands of our inheritance divided.
29 And the Lamanites did give unto us the land “northward, yea, even to the ’narrow passage which led into the land southward. And we did give unto the Lamanites all the land southward.

2 And it came to pass that the Lord did say unto me: Cry unto this

people—Repent ye, and come unto me, and be ye baptized, and build up again my church, and ye shall be “spared.
3 And I did cry unto this people, but it was “in vain; and they did °not realize that it was the Lord that had spared them, and granted unto them a chance for repentance. And behold they did harden their hearts against the Lord their God.
4 And it came to pass that after this tenth year had passed away, making, in the whole, three hundred and sixty years from the coming of Christ, the king of the Lamanites sent an epistle unto me, which gave unto me to know that they were preparing to come again to battle against us.
5 And it came to pass that I did cause my people that they should gather themselves together at the land ‘Desolation, to a city which was in the borders, by the narrow pass which led into the land "south- ward.
6 And there we did place our armies, that we might stop the armies of the Lamanites, that they might not get possession of any of our lands; therefore we did fortify against them with all our force.
7 And it came to pass that in the three hundred and sixty and first year the Lamanites did come down to the “city of Desolation to battle against us; and it came to pass that in that year we did beat them, in- somuch that they did return to their own lands again.
8 And in the *three hundred and sixty and second year they did come down “again to battle. And we did beat them again, and did slay a great 3 2a Hel. 15: 17 (16-17); 8a Morm. 2

number of them, and their dead were cast into the sea.
9 And now, because of this great thing which my people, the Ne- phites, had done, they began to "boast in their own strength, and began to swear before the heavens that they would avenge themselves of the blood of their brethren who had been slain by their enemies.
10 And they did ’swear by the heavens, and also by the throne of God, that they would goup to battle against their enemies, and would cut them off from the face of the land.
11 And it came to pass that I, Mormon, did utterly “refuse from this time forth to be a commander and a leader of this people, because of their wickedness and abomina- tion.
12 Behold, I had led them, not- withstanding their wickedness I had led them many times to battle, and had loved them, according to the “love of God which was in me, with all my heart; and my soul had been poured out in prayer unto my God all the day long for them; neverthe- less, it was "without faith, because of the ‘hardness of their hearts.
13 And “thrice have I delivered them out of the hands of their enemies, and they have repented not of their sins.
14 And when they had sworn by all that had been “forbidden them by our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, that they would go up unto their enemies to battle, and avenge them- selves of the blood of their brethren, behold the voice of the Lord came unto me, saying:

’repay; and because this people repented not after I had delivered them, behold,.they shall be cut off from the face of the earth.
16 And it came to pass that I utterly refused to go up against mine enemies; and I did even as the Lord had commanded me; and I did stand as an idle witness to manifest unto the world the things which I saw and heard, according to the manifestations of the Spirit which had testified of things to come.
17 Therefore I write “unto you, Gentiles, and also unto you, house of Israel, when the work shall com- mence, that ye shall be about to prepare to return to the land of your inheritance;
18 Yea, behold, I write unto all the ends of the earth; yea, unto you, twelve tribes of Israel, who shall be *judged according to your works by the twelve whom Jesus chose to be his disciples in the land of Jerusalem.
19 And I write also unto the rem- nant of this people, who shall also be judged by the “twelve whom Jesus chose in this land; and they shall be judged by the other twelve whom Jesus chose in the land of Jerusalem.
20 And these things doth the Spirit manifest unto me; therefore I write unto you all. And for this cause I write unto you, that ye may know that ye must all stand before the *judgment-seat of Christ, yea, every soul who belongs to the whole human “family of Adam; and ye must stand to be judged of your works, whether they be good or evil;
21 And also that ye may “believe the gospel of Jesus Christ, which ye shall "have among you; and also that the ‘Jews, the covenant people

AND now it came to pass that in the *three hundred and sixty and third year the Nephites did go up with their armies to “battle against the Lamanites, out of the land Desolation.
2 And it came to pass that the armies of the Nephites were driven back again to the land of Desolation.
And while they were yet weary, a |
fresh army of the.-Lamanites did come upon them; and they had a sore battle, insomuch that the Lamanites did take possession. of the “city Desolation, and did slay many of the Nephites, and did take many prisoners.
3 And the remainder did flee and join the inhabitants of the city Teancum. Now the city Teancum lay in the borders by the seashore; and it was-also near the city “Desolation.

smitten; for were it not‘for that, the Lamanites could have had no power over them.
5 But, behold, the judgments of God will overtake the “wicked; and it is by the wicked that the wicked are "punished; for it is the wicked that stir up the hearts of the children of men unto bloodshed.
6 And it. came to pass that the Lamanites did make preparations to come against the city Teancum.
7 And it came to pass in the three hundred and sixty and fourth year the Lamanites did come against the city Teancum, that they might take possession of the city Teancum also.
8 And it came to pass that they were repulsed and driven back by the Nephites. And when the Ne- phites saw that they had driven the Lamanites they did again “boast of their own strength; and they went forth in their own might, and took possession again of the city Desola- tion.
9 And now all these things had been done, and there had been thousands slain on both sides, both the Nephites and the Lamanites.
10 And it came to pass that the three hundred and sixty and sixth year had passed away, and the Lamanites came again upon the Nephites to battle; and yet the Nephites repented not of the evil they had done, but persisted in their wickedness continually.
11 And it is impossible for the tongue to describe, or for man to write a perfect description of the horrible scene of the blood and carnage which was among. the people, both of the Nephites and of the Lamanites; and every heart was hardened, so that they ‘“de- lighted in the shedding of blood continually.

12 And there never had been so great “wickedness among all the children of Lehi, nor even among all the house of Israel, according to the words of the Lord, as was among this people.
13 And it came to pass that the Lamanites did take possession of the city Desolation, and this because their “number did exceed the num- ber of the Nephites.
14 And they did also march for- ward against the city Teancum, and did drive the inhabitants forth out of her, and did take many prisoners both women and children, and did offer them up as “sacrifices unto their idol gods.
15 And it came to pass that in the three hundred and sixty and seventh year, the Nephites being angry because the Lamanites had: sacri- ficed their women and their children, that they did go against the Laman- ites with exceedingly great anger, insomuch that they did beat again the Lamanites, and drive them out of their lands.
16 And the Lamanites did not come again against the Nephites until the three hundred and seventy and fifth year.
17 And in this year they did come down against the Nephites with all their powers; and they were not numbered because of the greatness of their number.
18 And “from this time forth did the Nephites gain no power over the Lamanites, but began to be swept off by them even as a dew before the sun.
19 And it came to pass that the Lamanites did come down against the “city Desolation; and there was an exceedingly sore battle fought in the land Desolation, in the which they did beat the Nephites.

20 And they fled again from before them, and they came to the city Boaz; and there they did stand against the Lamanites with exceed- ing boldness,- insomuch that the Lamanites did not beat them until they had come again the second time.
21 And when they had come the second time, the Nephites were driven and slaughtered with an exceedingly great slaughter; their women and their “children were again sacrificed unto idols.
22 And it came to pass that the Nephites did again flee from before them, taking all the inhabitants with them, both in towns and villages.
23 And now I, Mormon, seeing that the Lamanites were about to over- throw the land, therefore I did go to the hill “Shim, and did take up all the "records which_Ammaron had hid up unto the Lord.
3 And it came to pass that the Lamanites did come against us as we had fled to the city of Jordan; but behold, they were driven back that they did not take the city at that time.
4 And it came to pass that they came against us again, and we did maintain the city. And there were also other cities which were main- tained by the Nephites, which strongholds did cut them off that they could not get into the country which lay before us, to destroy the inhabitants of our land.
5 But it came to pass that what- soever lands we had passed by, and the inhabitants thereof were not gathered in, were destroyed by the Lamanites, and their towns, and villages, and cities were burned with fire; and thus three hundred and seventy and nine years passed away.
6 And it came to pass that in the three hundred and eightieth year the Lamanites did come again against us to battle, and we did stand against them boldly; but it was all in vain, for so “great were their numbers that they did tread the people of the Nephites under their feet.
7 And it came to pass that we did again take to flight, and those whose flight was swifter than the Laman- ites’ did escape, and those whose flight did not exceed the Lamanites’ were swept down and destroyed.
8 And now behold, I, Mormon, do not desire to harrow up the souls of men in casting before them such an awful scene of blood and carnage as was laid before mine eyes; but I, knowing that these things must surely be made known, and that all things. which are hid must be “revealed upon the house-tops—
9 And also that a knowledge of these things must “come unto the remnant of these people, and also
CHAPTER 5
Mormon again leads the Nephite armies in battles of blood and carnage —The Book of Mormon shall come forth to convince all Israel that Jesus is the Christ—The Lamanites shall be a dark, filthy, and loathsome people— They shall receive the gospel from the Gentiles in the latter days.
AND it came to pass that I did go forth among the Nephites, and did repent of the 7oath which I had made that I would no more assist them; and they gave me command again of their armies, for they looked upon me as though I could deliver them from their afflictions.
2 But behold, I was “without hope, for 1 knew the judgments of the Lord which should come upon them ; for they repented not of their iniquities, but did struggle for their lives without calling upon that Being who created them.

unto the Gentiles, who the Lord hath said should °scatter this people, and this people should be*:counted as naught among them—therefore ‘I write a “small abridgment, daring not to give a full account of the things which I have seen, because of the commandment which I have received, and also that ye might not have too great sorrow because of the wickedness of this people.
10 And now behold, this I speak unto their seed, and also to the Gentiles who have care for the house of Israel, that realize and know from whence their blessings come.
11 For I know that such will sorrow for the calamity of the house of Israel; yea, they will sorrow for the destruction of this people; they will sorrow that this people had not repented that they might have been clasped in the arms of Jesus.
12 Now “these things are written unto the ‘remnant of the house of Jacob; and they are written after this manner, because it is known of God that wickedness will not bring them forth unto them; and they are to be “hid up unto the Lord that they may come forth.in his own due time.
13 And this is the commandment which I have received; and behold, they “shall come forth according to the commandment of the Lord, when he shall see fit, in his wisdom.
14 And behold, they shall go unto the “unbelieving of the >Jews; and for this intent shall they go—that they may be ‘persuaded that Jesus

15 And also that the seed of “this people may more fully believe his gospel, which shall °go forth unto them. from the Gentiles; for this people shall be ‘scattered, and shail 4become a dark, a filthy, and a loath- some people, beyond the description of that which ever hath been a- mongst us, yea, even that which hath been among the Lamanites, and this because of their unbelief and idolatry.
16 For behold, the Spirit of the Lord hath already ceased to “strive with their fathers; and they are without Christ and God in the world; and they are driven about as chaff before the wind.
17 They were once a delightsome people, and they had Christ for their *shepherd; yea, they were led even by God the Father.

The Nephites gather to the land of Cumorah. for the final battles— Mormon hides the sacred records in the hill Cumorah—The . Lamanites are victorious, and the Nephite nation is destroyed—Hundreds of thousands are slain with the sword.

2 And I, Mormon, wrote an epistle | unto the king of the Lamanites, and desired of him that he would grant | unto us that we might gather | together our people unto the “land of °Cumorah, by a hill which was | called Cumorah, and there we could | give them battle. I]
3 And it came to pass that the king | of the Lamanites did grant unto me | the thing which I desired. \|
4 And it came to pass that we did march forth to the land of Cumorah, and we did pitch our tents round about the hill Cumorah; and it was inaland of “many waters, rivers, and fountains; and here we had hope to gain advantage over the Lamanites.
5 And *when “three hundred and eighty and four years had passed away, we had gathered in all the remainder of our people unto the land Cumorah.
6 And it came to pass that when we had gathered in all our people in one to the land of Cumorah, behold I, Mormon, began to be old; and knowing it to be the last struggle of my people, and having been com- manded of the Lord that I should not suffer the records which had been handed down by our fathers, which were “sacred, to fall into the |
hands of the Lamanites, (for the |
Lamanites would °destroy them) therefore I made ‘this record out of the plates of Nephi, and “hid up in the hill Cumorah all the records which had been entrusted to me by the hand of the Lord, save it were ‘these few plates which I gave unto my son ‘Moroni.

7 And it-came to pass that my people, with their wives and their children, did now behotdthe @armies of the Lamanites marching towards them; and with that awful fear of death which fills the breasts of all the wicked, did they await to receive them. %
8 And it came to pass that they came to battle against us, and every: soul was filled with terror because of the greatness of their numbers.
9 And it came to pass that they did fall upon my people with the sword, and with the bow, and with the arrow, and with the ax, and with all manner of weapons of war.
10 And it came to pass that my men were hewn down, yea, even my "ten thousand who were with me, and I fell wounded in the midst; and they passed by me that they did not put an end to my life.
11 And when they had gone through and hewn down “all my people save it were twenty and four of us, (among whom was my son Moroni) and we having survived the dead of our people, did behold on the morrow, when the Lamanites had returned unto their camps, from the top of the hill Cumorah, the ten thousand of my people who were hewn down, being led in the front by me.
12 And we also beheld the ten thousand of my people who were led by my son Moroni.
13 And behold, the ten thousand of Gidgiddonah had fallen, and he also in the midst.
14 And Lamah had fallen with his ten thousand; and Gilgal had fallen with his ten thousand; and Limhah had fallen with his ten thousand; and Jeneum had fallen with his ten thousand; and Cumenihah, and Moronihah, and Antionum, and Shiblom, and Shem, and Josh, had
MORMON 6:7-22
fallen with their ten thousand each.
15.And it came to pass that there were ten more who did fall by the sword, with their ten thousand each; yea, even all my people, save it were those twenty and four who were with me, and also a "few who had escaped into the south countries, and a few who had deserted over unto the Lamanites, had fallen; and their flesh, and bones, and blood lay upon the face of the earth, being left by the hands of those who slew them to molder upon the land, and to crumble and to return to their mother earth.
16 And my soul was rent with “anguish, because of the slain of my people, and I cried:
17 °O ye fair ones, how could ye have departed from the ways of the Lord! O ye fair ones, how could ye have rejected that Jesus, who stood with open arms to receive you!
18 Behold, if ye had not done this, ye wouldnot have fallen. But behold, ye are fallen, and I?mourn your loss.
19 O ye “fair sons and daughters, ye fathers and mothers, ye husbands and wives, ye fair ones, how is it that ye could have "fallen !
20 But behold, ye are gone, and my. sorrows cannot bring your return.
21 And the day soon cometh that your mortal must put on im- mortality, and these bodies which are now moldering in corruption must soon become. “incorruptible bodies; and then ye must stand before the judgment-seat of Christ, to be: judged according to your works; and if it so be that ye are righteous, then are ye blessed with your fathers who have gone before

Mormon invites the Lamanites of the latter days to believe in Christ, accept his gospel, and be saved—All who believe the Bible will also believe the Book of Mormon.
AND now, behold, I would speak somewhat unto the “remnant of this people who are spared, if it so be that God may give unto them my words, that they may know of the things of their fathers; yea, I speak unto you, ye remnant of the house of Israel; and these are the words which I speak:
2 Know ye that ye are of the “house of Israel.
3 Know ye that ye must come unto repentance, or ye cannot be saved.
4 Know ye that ye must lay down your weapons of war, and delight no more in the shedding of blood, and take them_not again, save it be that God shall ?command you.
5 Know ye that ye must come to the “knowledge of your fathers, and repent of all your sins and iniquities, and °believe in Jesus Christ, that he is the Son of God, and that he was slain by the Jews, and by the power of the Father he hath risen again, whereby he hath gained the ‘victory over the grave; and also in him is the sting of death swallowed up.

6 And he bringeth to pass the | “resurrection of the dead, whereby man must be raised to stand before his °judgment-seat.
7 And he hath brought to pass the "redemption of the ’world, whereby he that is found ‘guiltless before him at the judgment day hath it given | unto him to ¢dwell in the presence of God in his kingdom, to sing cease- less praises with the ‘choirs above, unto the Father, and unto the Son, and unto the Holy Ghost, which are fone God, in a state of “happiness which hath no end.

The Lamanites seek out and destroy the Nephites—The Book of Mormon shall come forth by the power of God— Woes pronounced upon those who breathe out wrath and strife against the work of the Lord—The Nephite record shall come forth in a day of wickedness, degeneracy, and apostasy.
BEHOLD I, “Moroni, do finish the ’record of my father, Mormon. Be- hold, Ihave but few things to write, which things I have been com- manded by my father.
2 And now it came to pass that after the “great and tremendous battle at Cumorah, behold, the Nephites who had escaped into the country south- ward were hunted by the °Laman- ites, until they were all destroyed.
3 And my father also was killed by them, and’I even “remain alone to write the sad tale of the destruction of my people. But behold, they. are gone, and I fulfil the commandment of my father. And whether they will slay me, I know not.
4 Therefore I will write and “hide up the records in the earth; and whither I go it mattereth not.
5 Behold, my father hath made “this record, and he hath written the intent thereof. And behold, I would write it also if I had room upon the °plates, but I have not; and ore I have none, for I am alone. My father hath been slain in battle, and all my kinsfolk, and I have not friends nor whither to go; and ‘how

6 Behold, **four hundred years have passed away since the coming of our Lord and Savior.
7 And behold, the Lamanites have hunted my people, the Nephites, down from city to city and from place to place, even until they are no more; and great has been their “fall; yea, great and marvelous is the destruction of my people, the Nephites.
8 And behold, it is the hand of the Lord which hath done it. And be- hold also, the Lamanites are at *war one with another; and the whole face of this land is one continual round of murder and bloodshed; and no one knoweth the end of the war.
9 And now, behold, I say no more concerning them, for there are none save it be the Lamanites and *robbers that do exist upon the face of the land.
10 And there are none that do know the true God save it be the “disciples of Jesus, who did tarry in the land until the wickedness of the people was so great that the Lord would not suffer them to *remain with the people; and whether they be upon the face of the land no man knoweth.
11 But behold, my “father and J have seen ’them, and they have ministered unto us.
12 And whoso receiveth “this record, and shall not condemn it because of the imperfections which are in it, the same shall know of bsreater things than these. Behold, I am Moroni;and were it possible, I would make all things Known unto you.

13 Behold, I make an end of speak- ing concerning this people. I am the son of Mormon,.and my father was a *descendant of Nephi.
14 And I am the same who “hideth up. this record unto the Lord; the plates thereof are of no worth, because of the commandment of the Lord. For he truly saith that no one shall have them °to get gain; but the record thereof is of ‘great worth; and whoso shall bring it to light, him will the Lord bless.
15 For none can have power to bring it to light save it be given him of God; for God wills that it shall be done with an “eye single to his glory, or the welfare of the ancient and long dispersed covenant people of the Lord.
16 And blessed be “he that. shall bring this thing to light; for it shall be "brought out of:darkness unto light, according to the word of God; yea, it shall be brought out of the earth, and it shall shine forth out of darkness, and come unto. the knowledge of the people; and it shall be done by the power of God.
17 And if there be “faults they be the faults of a man. But behold, we know no. fault; nevertheless God knoweth all things; therefore, he that °condemneth, let him be aware lest he shall be in danger of hell fire.
18 And he that saith: Show unto me, or ye shall be “smitten—let him beware lest he commandeth that which is forbidden of the Lord.
19 For behold, the same. that “judgeth "rashly shall be judged rashly again; for according to his
482 |
works shall his wages be; therefore, he that smiteth shall be smitten again, of the Lord. |
20 Behold what the scripture says —man shall not ¢smite, neither shall he °judge; for judgment is mine, | saith the Lord, and vengeance is | mine also, and I will repay.
21 And he that shall breathe out “wrath and °strifes against the work of the Lord, and against the ‘cove- nant people of the Lord who are the house of Israel, and shall say: We will destroy the work of the Lord, and the Lord will not remember his covenant which he hath made unto the house of Israel—the same is in danger to be hewn down and cast into-the fire;
22 For the eternal “purposes of the Lord shall roll on, until all his promises shall be fulfilled.

Behold, I cannot write them. -Yea, behold I say unto you, that those saints who have gone before me, who have possessed this land, shall ’cry, yea, even from the dust will they cry unto the Lord; and as the Lord liveth he will remember the covenant which he hath made with them.
24 And he knoweth their “prayers, that they were in behalf of their brethren. And he knoweth their faith, for in his name could they remove ’mountains; and in his name could they cause the earth to shake; and by the power of his word did they cause ‘prisons to tumble to the earth; yea, even the fiery furnace could not harm them, neither wild

not think that greater is the value of
an endless happiness than that ’misery which never dies—because of the ‘praise of the world?
39 Why do ye adorn yourselves with that which hath no life, and yet suffer thehungry,and the needy, and the naked, and the sick and the afflicted to pass by you, and notice them not?
40 Yea, why do ye build up your *secret abominations to get gain, and cause that widows shouldmourn before the Lord, and also orphans to mourn before the Lord, and also the blood of their fathers and their husbands to cry unto the Lord from the ground, for vengeance upon your heads?

AND now, I speak also concerning | those who do not believe in Christ.
2 Behold, will ye believe in the day | of your visitation—behold, when the Lord shall come, yea, eventhat | *¢great day when the "earth shall be | rolled: together as a scroll, and the | elements shall ‘melt with fervent | heat, yea, in that great day when ye | shall be brought to stand before the | Lamb of God—then will ye say that there is no. God?
3 Then will ye longer deny. the | Christ, or can ye behold the Lamb of God? Do ye suppose that ye shall dwell with him under a “conscious- | ness of your guilt? Do ye suppose that ye could be happy to dwell with that holy Being, when your souls are racked with a consciousness of guilt that ye have ever abused his laws?
4 Behold, I say unto you that ye would be more miserable to dwell with a holy and just God, under a consciousness of your “filthiness before him, than ye would to dwell with the ’damned souls in ‘hell.
5 For behold, when ye shall be brought to see your ‘nakedness be- fore God, and also the glory of God, and the "holiness of Jesus Christ, it will kindle a flame of unquenchable fire upon you.

‘pure, fair, and white, having been cleansed by the blood of:-the “Lamb, at that great and last day.
7 And again I speak unto you who *deny the revelations of God, and
say that they are done away, that
there are no revelations, nor proph- ecies, nor gifts, nor healing, nor speaking with tongues, and the ‘interpretation of tongues;
8 Behold I say unto you, he that denieth these things knoweth not the “gospel of Christ; yea, he has not read the scriptures; if so, he does not understand them.
9 For do we not read that God is the "same yesterday, today, and for- ever, and in him there is no ‘variable- hess neither shadow of changing?
10 And now, if ye have imagined up unto yourselves a god who doth vary, and in whom there is shadow of changing, then have ye imagined up unto yourselves a god who is not a God of miracles.
11 But behold, I will show unto you a God of “miracles, even the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob; and it | is that same °God who created the _ heavens and the earth, and all things that in them are.
12 Behold, he created Adam, and by?Adam came the “fall of man. And _ because of the fall of man came Jesus _ Christ, even the Father and the ' Son; and because of Jesus Christ
came the ‘redemption of man. 13 And because of the’ redemption of man, which came by Jesus Christ, they are brought back into the
MORMON 9:7-17
“presence of the Lord; yea, this is wherein all men are redeemed, because the death of Christ bringeth to pass the resurrection, which bringeth to pass a redemption from an endless ‘sleep, from which sleep all men shall be-awakened by the power of God when the trump shall sound; and they shall come forth, both small and great, and all shall stand before his bar, being redeemed and loosed from this eternal ¢band of death, which death is a temporal death.
14 And then cometh the “judgment of the Holy One upon them; and then cometh the time that he that is >filthy shall be filthy still; and he that is righteous shall be righteous still; he that is happy shall be happy still; and he that is unhappy shall be unhappy still.
15 And now, O all ye that have imagined up unto yourselves a god who can do “no miracles, I would ask of you, have all these things passed, of which I have spoken? Has the end come yet? Behold I say unto you, Nay; and God has not ceased
. to be a God of miracles.
16 Behold, are not the things that God hath wrought marvelous in our eyes? Yea, and who can comprehend the marvelous “works of God?
17 Who shall say that it was not a miracle that by his ‘word the heaven and the earth should be; and by the power of his word man was "created of the “dust of the earth; and by the power of his word have miracles been wrought ?

18 And who shall say that Jesus Christ did not do many mighty ¢miracles? And there were many ’mighty miracles wrought by the hands of the apostles.
19 And if there were “miracles wrought then, why has God ceased to be a God of miracles and yet be an unchangeable Being? And behold, I say unto you he ’changeth not; if so he would cease to be God; and he ceaseth not to be God, and is a God of miracles.
20 And the reason why he ceaseth to do “miracles among the children of men is because that they dwindle in unbelief, and depart from the tight way, and know not the God in whom they should "trust.

4 Therefore I do not write those things which transpired from the days of 7Adam until that time; but they are had upon the plates; and whoso findeth them, the same will have power that he may get the full account.

The Jaredites prepare for their journey to a promised land—It is a choice land whereon men must serve Christ or be swept off—The Lord talks to the brother of Jared for three hours— They build barges—The Lord asks the brother of Jared to propose how the barges shall be lighted.
AND it came to pass that Jared and his brother, and their families, and also the “friends of Jared and his brother and their families, went down into the valley which was northward, (and the name of the valley was °Nimrod, being called after the mighty hunter) with their ‘flocks which they had gathered together, male and female, of every kind.
2 And they did also lay snares and catch “fowls of the air; and they did also prepare a vessel, in which they did carry with them the fish of the waters.
3 And they did also carry with them deseret, which, by interpreta- tion, is a honey bee; and thus they did carry with them “swarms of bees, and all manner of that which was upon the face of the land, ’seeds of every kind.

into that quarter where there never had man been. And it came to pass that the Lord did go before them, and did talk with them as he stood in a "cloud, and gave ‘directions whither they should travel.

6 And it came to pass that. they did travel in the wilderness, and did “build barges, in which they did cross many waters, being directed continually by the hand of the Lord.
7 And the Lord would not suffer that they should stop beyond the sea in the wilderness, but he would that they should come forth even unto the “land of promise, which was choice above all other lands, which the Lord God had °preserved for a righteous people.
8 And he had sworn in his wrath unto the brother of Jared, that whoso should possess this land of promise, from that time henceforth and forever, should “serve him, the true and only God, or they should be °’swept off when the fulness of his wrath should come upon them.
9 And now, we can behold the decrees of God concerning this land, that it is a land of promise; and whatsoever nation shall possess it shall serve God, or they shall be *swept off when the fulness of his >wrath shall come upon them. And the fulness of his wrath cometh upon them when they are ‘ripened in iniquity.
10 For behold, this isa land which is choice above all other lands; wherefore he that doth possess it shall serve God or shall be “swept off; for it is the everlasting decree of God. And it is not until the °fulness of iniquity among the children of the land, that they are ‘swept off.

13 And now I proceed with my record; for behold, it came to pass that the Lord did bring Jared and | his brethren forth even to that great sea which divideth the lands. And as they came to the sea they pitched their tents; and they called the name of the place *Moriancumer; and they dwelt in ’tents, and dwelt in tents upon the seashore for the space of four years.
14 And it came to pass at the end of four years that the Lord came again unto the brother of Jared, and stood ina cloud.and “talked with him. And for the space of three hours did the Lord talk with the brother of Jared; and °chastened him because he remembered not to ‘call upon the name of the Lord.
15 And the brother of Jared re- pented of the evil which he had done, and did call upon the name of the Lord for his brethren who were with him. And the Lord said unto him: I will forgive thee and thy brethren of their sins; but thou shalt not sin

And these are my ‘thoughts upon the land which I shall give you for your inheritance; for it shall be a land 4choice above all other lands.
16 And the Lord said: Go to work and build, after the manner of *barges which ye havehitherto built. And it came to pass that the brother of Jared did go to work, and also his brethren, and built barges after the manner which they had built, according to the °instructions of the Lord. And they weresmall, and they were light upon the water, even like unto the lightness of a fowl upon the water.
17 And they were built after a manner that they were exceedingly "tight, even that they would hold water like unto a dish; and the bottom thereof was tight like unto a dish; and the- sides thereof were tight like unto a dish; and the ends thereof were peaked; and the top thereof was tight like unto a dish; and the length thereof was the length of a tree; and the door thereof, when it was shut, was tight like unto a dish.
18 And it came to pass that the brother of Jared cried unto the Lord, saying: O Lord, I have performed the work which thou hast com- manded me, and I have made the barges according as thou hast directed me. -
19 And behold, O Lord, in them there is no light; whither shall we steer? And also we shall perish, for in them we cannot breathe, save it is the air which is in them; therefore we shall perish.

And if it be so that the water come in upon thee, behold, ye shall stop the hole, that ye may not perish in the flood.
21 And it came to pass that the brother of Jared did so, according as the Lord had commanded.
22 And he cried again unto» the Lord saying: O Lord, behold I have done even as thou hast commanded me; and I have prepared the vessels for my people, and behold there is no light in them: Behold, O Lord, wilt thou suffer that we shall cross this great water in darkness?
23 And the Lord said unto the brother of Jared: What will ye that I should do that ye may have light in your vessels? For behold, ye can- not have “windows, for they will be dashed in pieces; neither shall ye take fire with you, for ye shall not go by the light of fire.
24. For behold, ye shall be as a ¢whale in the midst of the sea; for the mountain waves shall dash upon you. Nevertheless, I will bring you up again out of the depths of the sea; for the winds have gone forth ‘out of my mouth, and also the 4rains and the floods have I ‘sent forth.
25 And behold, I prepare you against these things; for ye cannot cross this great deep save I prepare you against the waves of the sea, and the winds which have gone forth, and the floods which shall come. Therefore what will ye that I should prepare for you that ye may have light when ye are swallowed up in the depths of the sea?

AND it came to pass that the brother of Jared, (now the number of the vessels which had been prepared was eight) went forth unto the 4mount, which they called the mount °Shelem, because of its exceeding height, and did ‘molten out of a rock sixteen small stones; and they were white and clear, even as transparent ¢glass; and he did carry them in his hands upon the top of the mount, and cried again unto the Lord, saying:

And the ‘veil was taken from off the eyes of the brother of Jared, and he saw the finger of the Lord; and it was as the finger of a man, like unto flesh and blood; and the brother of Jared “fell down before the Lord, for he was struck with “fear. )

12 And he answered: Yea, Lord, I know that thou speakest the truth, for thou art a God of truth, and “canst not lie.

18 And he ministered unto him even as he ministered unto the Nephites; and all this, that this man might know that he was God, be- cause of the many great works which the Lord had showed unto him.
19 And because of the “knowledge of this man he could not be kept from. beholding within the °veil; and he saw the finger of Jesus, which, when he saw, he fell with fear ; for he knew that it was the finger of the Lord; and he had ‘faith no longer, for he knew, nothing “doubting.
20 Wherefore, having this perfect knowledge of God, he could “not be kept from within the veil; therefore he ’saw Jesus; and he did minister unto him.
21 And it came to pass that the Lord said unto the brother of Jared: Behold, thou shalt not suffer these things which ye have seen and heard to go forth unto the world, until the “time cometh that I shall glorify my name in the flesh; wherefore, ye shall ’treasure up the things which ye have seen and heard, and show it to no man.

3 And thus the Lord caused stones to shine in darkness, to give light
_ unto men, women, and children,
that they might not cross the great waters in darkness.
4 And it came to pass that when they had prepared all manner of *food, that thereby they might sub- sist upon the water, and also food for their flocks and herds, and ’what- soever beast or animal or fowl that they should carry with them—and it came to pass that when they had done all these things they got aboard of their vessels or barges, and set forth into the sea, commending themselves unto the Lord their God.
5 And it came to pass that the Lord God caused that there should be a *furious wind blow upon the face of the waters, "towards the promised land; and thus they were tossed upon the waves of the sea before the

7 And it came to pass that when they were buried in the deep there was no water that could hurt them, their vessels being “tight like unto a
_ dish, and also they were tight like unto the "’ark of Noah; therefore
when they were encompassed about
by many waters they did cry unto
the Lord, and he did bring them forth again upon the top of the waters.

9 And they did “sing praises unto the Lord; yea, the brother of Jared did sing praises unto the Lord, and he did ’thank and praise the Lord all the day long; and when the night came, they did not cease to praise the Lord.
10 And thus they were driven forth; and no monster of the sea could break them, neither “whale that could mar them; and they did have light continually, whether it was above the water or under the water.
11 And thus they were driven forth, *three hundred and forty and four days upon the water.
12 And they did “land upon the shore of the "promised land. And when they had set their feet upon the shores of the promised land they bowed themselves down upon the face of the land, and did humble themselves before the Lord, and did shed tears of joy before the Lord, because of the multitude of his ‘tender mercies over them.
13 And it came to pass that they went forth upon the face of the land, and began to till the earth.

15 And the brother of Jared also begat sons and daughters.
16 And the “friends of Jared and his brother were in number about twenty-and two souls; and they also begat sons and daughters before they came to the promised land; and therefore they began to be many.

were also ’taught from on high.
18 And it came to pass that they began to spread upon the face of
the land, and to multiply and to till
the earth; and they did wax strong
in the land.
19 And the brother of Jared began to be old, and saw that he must soon go down to the grave; wherefore he said unto Jared: Let us gather to- gether our people that we may
number them, that we may know of
them what they will desire of us before we go down to our graves.
20 And accordingly the people were gathered together. Now the number of the sons and the daughters of the brother of Jared were twenty and two souls; and the number of sons and daughters of Jared were twelve, he having four sons.
21 And it came to pass that they did number their people; and after that they had numbered them, they did desire of them the things which they would that they should. do before they went down to their graves.
22 And it came to pass that the people desired of them that they should “anoint one of their sons to be a king over them.
23 And now behold, this was grievous unto them. And the brother of Jared said unto them: Surely this thing “leadeth into captivity.
24 But Jared said unto his brother: Suffer them that they may have a king. And therefore he said unto them: Choose ye out from among our sons a king, even whom ye will.
25 And it came to pass that they chose even the firstborn of the brother of Jared; and his name was Pagag. And it came to pass that he refused and would not be their“king, And the people would that his father should constrain him, but his father would not ; and he commanded them

Orihah reigns in righteousness—Amid | usurpation and strife the rival king- doms of Shule and Cohor are set up —Prophets condemn the wickedness and idolatry of the people, who then repent.
AND it came to pass that Orihah did execute judgment upon the land in righteousness all his days, whose days were exceedingly many.
2 And he begat sons and daughters; yea, he begat thirty and one, among whom were twenty and three sons. |

land of *Moron where the king dwelt, and took him captive, which *brought to pass the saying of the brother of Jared that they would be brought into captivity.
6 Now the “land of Moron, where the king dwelt, was near the land which is called Desolation by the Nephites.
7 And it came to pass that Kib dwelt in *captivity, and his people under Corihor his son, until he be- came exceedingly old; nevertheless Kib begat Shule in his old age, while he was yet in captivity.
8 And it came to pass that Shule was angry with his brother; and Shule waxed strong, and became mighty as to the strength of a man; and he was also mighty in judgment.
9 Wherefore, he came to the hill | Ephraim, and he did molten out of
the hill, and made swords out of 9steel for those whom he had drawn away with him; and after he had armed them with swords he returned to the city Nehor, and gave battle unto his brother Corihor, by which means he obtained the kingdom and restored it unto his father Kib.
10 And now because of the thing which Shule had done, his father be- stowed upon him the kingdom; }, therefore he began to reign in the } stead of his father. | 11 And it came to pass that he did execute judgment in righteousness ; | and he did spread his kingdom upon | all the face of the land, for the people
_ had become exceedingly numerous. _ 12 And it came to pass that Shule
also begat many sons and daughters.
13 And Corihor repented of the many evils which he had done; | wherefore Shule gave him power in

rebelled against Shule, the king, and also his father Corihor, and drew away Cohor his brother, and also all his brethren and many of the people.
16 And he gave battle unto Shule, the king, in which he did obtain the land of their “first inheritance; and he became a king over that part of the land.
17 And it came to pass that he gave battle again unto Shule, the king; and he took Shule, the king, and car- tied him away captive into Moron.
18 And it came to pass as he was about to put him to death, the sons of Shule crept into the house of Noah by night and slew him, and broke down the door of the prison and brought out their father, and placed him upon his throne in his own kingdom.
19 Wherefore, the son of Noah did build up his kingdom in his stead; nevertheless they did not gain power any more over Shule the king, and the people who were under the reign of Shule the king did prosper exceed- ingly and wax great.
20 And the country was “divided; and there were two kingdoms, the kingdom of Shule, and the kingdom of Cohor, the son of Noah.
21 And Cohor, the son of Noah, caused that his people should give battle unto Shule, in which Shule did beat them and did slay Cohor.
22 And now Cohor had a son who was called Nimrod; and Nimrod gave up the kingdom of Cohor unto Shule, and he did gain favor in the eyes of Shule; wherefore Shule did bestow great favors upon him, and he did do in the kingdom of Shule according to his desires.
23 And also in the reign of Shule there came “prophets among the people, who were sent from the Lord, prophesying that the wickedness and ‘idolatry of the people was bringing a curse upon the land, and they should be destroyed if they did not repent.

5 And they were exceedingly angry because of the doings of Jared | their brother, insomuch that they | did raise an army and gave battle unto Jared. And it came to pass that | they did give battle unto him by night.
6 And it came to pass that when they had slain the army of Jared they were about to slay him also; || and he plead with them that they | would not slay him, and he would | give up the kingdom unto his father. And it came to pass that they did grant unto him his life.
7 And now Jared became exceed- ingly “sorrowful because of the loss. | of the kingdom, for he had set his heart upon the kingdom and upon the glory of the world.
8 Now the daughter of Jared being exceedingly expert, and seeing the sorrows of her father, thought to devise a plan whereby she could re- deem the kingdom unto her father. |
9 Now the daughter of Jared was. | exceedingly fair. And it came to pass that she did talk with her father, and said unto him: Whereby hath my father so much sorrow? Hath he not read the “record which our fathers brought across the great deep? Behold, is there not an >account concerning them of ‘old, that they by their “secret plans did obtain kingdoms and great glory?

25 And he did execute a law throughout all the land, which gave power unto the prophets that they should go whithersoever they would ; and by this cause the people were brought unto repentance.
26 And because the people did repent of their iniquities and idola- tries the Lord did spare them, and they began to prosper again in the land. And it came to pass that Shule "begat sons and daughters in his old age.
27 And there were no more wars in. the days of Shule; and he remem- bered the great things that the Lord had done for his fathers in bringing them 2across the great deep into the promised land; wherefore he did execute judgment in righteousness all his days.

There is strife and contention over the kingdom—Akish forms an _ oath- bound secret combination to slay the king—Secret combinations are of the devil and result in the destruction of nations— Modern Gentiles are warned against the secret combination which shall seek to overthrow the freedom of all lands, nations, and countries.
AND it came to pass that he begat Omer, and Omer reigned in his stead. And Omer begat Jared; and Jared begat sons and daughters.
2 And Jared rebelled against his father, and came and dwelt in the land of Heth. And it came to pass that he did “flatter many people, be- cause of his cunning words, until he had gained the half of the kingdom.

sought power to gain power, and to murder, and to plunder,:and to lie, and to commit all manner of wickedness and whoredoms.
17 And it was the daughter of Jared who put it into his heart to search up these things of old; and Jared put it into the heart of Akish; wherefore, Akish administered it unto his kindred and friends, leading them away by fair promises to do whatso- ever thing he desired.
18 And it came to pass that they formed a secret *combination, even as they of old; which combination is most abominable and wicked above all, in the sight of God;
19 For the Lord worketh not: in secret combinations, neither doth he will that man should shed blood, but in all things hath forbidden it, from the beginning of man.
20 And now I, Moroni, do not write the manner of their oaths and combinations, for it hath been made known unto me that they are had “among all people, and they are had among the Lamanites.
21 And they have caused the destruction of this people of whom I am now speaking, and also the destruction of the people of Nephi.
22 And whatsoever @nation shall uphold such secret combinations, to get power and gain, until they shall spread over the nation, behold, they shall be destroyed; for the Lord will not suffer that the °blood of his saints, which shall be shed by them, shall always cry unto him from the ground for “vengeance upon them and yet he avenge them not.

which are built up to get 7power and gain—and the work, yea, even the work of ’destruction come upon you, yea, even the sword of the justice of the Eternal God shall fall upon you, to your overthrow and destruction if ye shall suffer these things to be.
24 Wherefore, the Lord command- eth you, when ye shall see these things come among you that ye shall awake to a sense of your awful situation, because of this “secret combination which shall be among you; or wo be unto it, because of the blood of them who have been slain; for they cry from the dust for vengeance upon it, and also upon those who built it up.
25 For it cometh to pass that who- so buildeth it up seeketh to over- throw the “freedom of all lands, nations, and ‘countries; and it bringeth to pass the destruction of all people, for it is built up by the devil, who is the father of all lies; even that same liar who °beguiled our first parents, yea, even that same liar who hath caused man ‘to commit murder from the beginning; who hath ‘hardened the hearts of men that they have ¢murdered the prophets, and stoned them, and cast them out from the beginning.
26 Wherefore, I, Moroni, am com- manded to write these things that evil may be done away, and that the time may come that Satan may have *no power upon the hearts of the children of men, but that they may be °persuaded to do good continu- ally, that they may come unto the fountain of all ‘righteousness and be saved.

2 Nevertheless, the Lord was | merciful unto Omer, and also to his | sons and to his daughters who did not seek his destruction.

4 And it came to pass that Jared was anointed king over the people, by the hand of wickedness; and he gave unto Akish his daughter to wife.
5 And it came to pass that Akish | “sought the life of his father-in-law; | and he applied unto those whom he had sworn by the oath of the ancients, and they obtained the head of his father-in-law, as he sat upon his throne, giving audience to his people.

And it came to pass that Emer did reign in his stead, and did fill the jsteps of his father.
16 And the Lord began again to

17 Having “all manner of fruit, and of grain, and of silks, and of fine linen, and of ‘gold, and of silver, and of precious things;
18 And also “all manner of cattle, of oxen; and cows, and: of sheep, and of swine, and of goats, and also many other kinds of animals which were useful for the food of man.
19 And they also had “horses, and asses, and there were elephants and cureloms and cumoms; all of which were useful unto man,. and more especially the elephants and. cure- loms and cumoms.

And thus the Lord did pour out his blessings upon this land, which was “choice above all other: lands; and he commanded: that whoso should possess the land’ should possess it unto the Lord, or they should: be »’destroyed when they were ripened in iniquity; for upon such, saith the Lord: I will pour out the fulness of my wrath.

26 And the people had spread again over all the face of the land, and there began again to be an exceedingly great wickedness upon the face of the land, and *Heth began to embrace*the secret plans again of old, to destroy his father.
27 And it:came to pass that he did dethrone his father, for he slew him with his own sword; and he did reign in his stead.
28 And there came prophets in the land “again, crying repentance unto them—that they must prepare the way of the Lord or there should come a curse upon the face of the land; yea, even there should be a great famine, in which they should be destroyed if they did not repent.
29 But the people believed not the words of the prophets, but they cast them out; and some of them they cast into “pits and left them to perish. And it came to pass that they did all these things according to the commandment of the king, Heth.
30 And it came to pass that there began to be a great “dearth upon the land, and the inhabitants began to be destroyed exceedingly fast be- cause of the dearth, for there was no rain upon the face of the earth.
31 And there came forth “poisonous

32 And it came to pass that there were many of them which did perish | by the way; nevertheless, there were some which fled into the land southward.
33 And it came to pass that the Lord did cause the “serpents that they should pursue them no more, but that they should hedge up the way that the people could not pass, that whoso should attempt to pass might fall by the poisonous serpents.
34 And it came to pass that. the people did follow the course of the beasts, and did devour the ¢car- casses of them which fell by the way, until they had devoured them all. Now when the people saw that they must °perish they began to ‘repent of their iniquities and cry unto the Lord.
35 And it came to pass that when they had “humbled themselves sufficiently before the Lord he did send rain upon the face of the earth; and the people began to revive again, and there began to be fruit in the north countries, and in all the countries round about. And the Lord did show forth his power unto them in preserving them from famine.

*Heth had perished by the famine, and all his household*save it were Shez—wherefore, Shez began to build up again a broken people.
2 And it came to pass that. Shez did remember the destruction of his fathers, and he did build up .a righteous kingdom; for he remem- bered what the Lord had done in bringing Jared and his brother “across the deep; and he did walk in the ways of the Lord; and he begat sons and daughters.
3 And his eldest son, whose name was Shez, did “rebel against him; nevertheless, Shez was smitten by the hand of a robber, because of his exceeding riches, which brought peace again unto his father.
4 And it came to pass that his father did build up many cities upon the face of the land, and the people began again to spread over all the face of the land. And Shez did live to an exceedingly old age; and he begat Riplakish. And he died, and Riplakish reigned in his stead.
5 And it came to pass that Rip- lakish did not do that which was right in the sight of the Lord, for he did have many wives and “con- cubines, and did lay that upon men’s shoulders which was grievous to be borne; yea, he did °tax them with heavy taxes; and with the taxes he did build many spacious buildings.
6 And he did erect him an exceed- ingly beautiful throne; and he did build many prisons, and whoso would not be subject unto taxes he did “cast into prison; and whoso was not able to pay taxes he did cast into prison; and he did cause that they should labor continually for their support; and whoso refused to labor he did cause to be put to death.
7 Wherefore he did obtain all his fine work, yea, even his fine “gold he did cause to be refined in prison; and all manner of fine "workmanship
ETHER 10:2-13
he did cause to be wrought in prison. And it came to pass that he did afflict the people with his whore- doms and abominations.
8 And when he had reigned for the space of forty and two years the people did rise up in rebellion against him; and there began to be war again in the land, insomuch that Riplakish was killed, and his de- scendants were driven out of the land.
9 And it came to pass after the space of many years, Morianton, che being a descendant of Riplakish) gathered together an army of out- casts, and went forth and gave battle unto the people; and he gained power over many cities; and the war became exceedingly sore, and did last for the space of many years; and he did gain power over all the land, and did establish him- self king over all the land.
10 And after that he had estab- lished himself king he did ease the burden of the people, by which he did gain favor in the eyes of the people, and they did anoint him to be their king.
11 And he did do justice unto the people, but not unto himself be- cause of his many “whoredoms; wherefore he was cut off from the presence of the Lord.
12 And it came to pass that Morian- ton built up many cities, and the people became exceedingly rich under his reign, both in buildings, and in “gold and silver, and in raising grain, and in flocks, and herds, and such things which had been restored unto them.
13 And Morianton did live to an exceedingly great age, and then he begat Kim; and Kim did reign in the stead of his father; and he did reign eight years, and his father died. And it came to pass that Kim did “not reign in righteousness,

wherefore he was not favored of the Lord.
14 And his brother did rise up in rebellion against him, by which he did bring him into “captivity; and he did remain in captivity all his days; and he begat sons and daughters in captivity, and in his old age he begat Levi; and he died.
15 And it came to pass that Levi
did serve in captivity after the |
death of his father, for the space of forty and two years. And he did make war against the king of the land, by which he did obtain unto himself the kingdom.
16 And after he had obtained unto himself the kingdom he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord; and the people did prosper in the land; and he did live to a good %9ld age, and begat sons and daughters; and he also begat Corom, whom he anointed king in his stead.
17 And it came to pass that Corom did that which was good in the sight of the Lord all his days; and he begat many sons and daughters; and after he had seen many days he did pass away, even like unto the rest of the earth; and Kish reigned in his stead.
18 And it came to pass that Kish passed away also, and Lib reigned in his stead.
19 And it came to pass that Lib also did that which was good in the sight of the Lord. And in the days of Lib the “poisonous serpents were destroyed. Wherefore they did go into the land southward, to hunt food for the people of the land, for the land was covered with animals of the forest. And Lib also himself became a great "hunter.
20 And they built a great city by the “narrow neck of land, by the
506 |
place where the sea divides the land.
21 And they did preserve the land *southward for a wilderness, to get game. And the whole face of the land northward was covered with inhabitants.
22 And they were exceedingly *industrious, and they did buy and sell and "traffic one with another, that they might get gain.
23 And they did “work in all man- ner of °ore, and they did make gold, and silver, and ‘iron, and “brass, and all manner of metals; and they did dig it out of the earth; where- fore, they did cast up mighty heaps of earth to get ore, of gold, and of silver, and of iron, and of copper. And they did ‘work all manner of fine work.
24 And they did have “silks, and fine-twined “linen; and they did work all manner of ‘cloth, that they might clothe themselves from their nakedness.
25 And they did make all manner of tools to till the earth, both to plow and to sow, to reap and to hoe, and also to thrash.
26 And they did make all manner of tools with which they did work their beasts.
27 And they did make all manner of “weapons of war. And they did work all manner of work of exceed- ingly curious workmanship.
28 And never could be a people more blessed than were they, and more prospered by the hand of the Lord. And they were in a land that was choice above all lands, for the Lord had spoken it.
29 And it came to pass that Lib did live many years, and begat sons and daughters; and he also begat Hearthom.

30 And it came to pass that Hearthom reigned inthe stead of his father. And when Hearthom had reigned twenty and four years, behold, the kingdom was taken away from him. And he served many years in “captivity, yea, even all the remainder of his days.
31 And he begat Heth, and Heth lived in captivity all his days. And Heth begat Aaron, and Aaron dwelt in captivity all his days; and he begat Amnigaddah, and Amnigad- dah also dwelt in captivity all his days; and he begat Coriantum, and Coriantum dwelt in captivity all his days; and he begat Com.
32 And it came to pass that Com drew away the half of the kingdom. And he reigned over the half of the kingdom forty and two years; and he went to battle against the king, Amgid, and they fought for the space of many years, during which time Com gained power over Amgid, and obtained power over the re- mainder of the kingdom.
33 And in the days of Com there began to be robbers in the land; and they adopted the old plans, and administered “oaths after the man- ner of the ancients, and sought again to destroy the kingdom.
34 Now Com did fight against them much; nevertheless, he did not prevail against them.
CHAPTER 11
Wars, dissensions, and wickedness dominate Jaredite life—Their proph- ets predict the utter destruction of the Jaredites unless they repent—The people reject the words of the prophets.
AND there came also in the days of Com many “prophets, and prophe- sied of the destruction of that great people except they should repent, and turn unto the Lord, and forsake their murders and wickedness.
ETHER 10:30-11:10
2 And it came to pass that the prophets were “rejected by the people, and they fled unto Com for protection, for the people sought to destroy them.
3 And they prophesied unto Com many things; and he was blessed in all the remainder of his days.
4 And he lived to a good old age, and begat Shiblom; and Shiblom reigned in his stead. And the brother of Shiblom rebelled against him, and there began to be an exceedingly great war in all the land.
5 And it came to pass that the brother of Shiblom caused that all the prophets who prophesied of the destruction of the people should be put to “death;
6 And there was great calamity in all the land, for they had testified that a great curse should come upon the land, and also upon the people, and that there should be a great destruction among them, such an one as never had been upon the face of the earth, and their bones should become as “heaps of earth upon the face of the land except they should repent of their wickedness.
7 And they hearkened not unto the voice of the Lord, because of their wicked combinations; wherefore, there began to be wars and ®con- tentions in all the land, and -also many famines and pestilences, inso- much that there was a great de- struction, such an one as never had been known upon the face of the earth; and all this came to pass in the days of Shiblom.
8 And the people began to repent of their iniquity; and inasmuch as they did the Lord did have “mercy on them.
9 And it came to pass that Shib- lom was slain, and Seth was brought into “captivity, and did dwell in captivity all his days.

11 And Ethem, being a descendant of Ahah, did obtain the kingdom; and he also did do that which was wicked in his days.
12 And it came to pass that in the days of Ethem there came many prophets, and prophesied again unto the people; yea, they did prophesy that the Lord would utterly ¢de- stroy them from off the face of the earth except they repented of their iniquities.
13 And it came to pass that the people hardened their hearts, and would not “*hearken unto. their words; and the prophets "mourned and withdrew from among the people.
14 And it came to pass that Ethem did execute judgment in wickedness all his days; and he begat Moron. And it came to pass that Moron did reign in his stead; and Moron did that which was wicked before the Lord.
15 And it came to pass that there arose a “rebellion among the people, because of that secret "combination which was built up to get power and gain; and there arose a mighty man among them in iniquity, and gave battle unto Moron, in which he did overthrow the half of the kingdom; and he did maintain the half of the kingdom for many years.
16 And it came to pass that Moron did overthrow him, and did obtain the kingdom again.
17 And it came to pass that there arose another mighty man; and he was a descendant of the brother of Jared.

18 And it came to pass that he did overthrow Moron and obtain the kingdom; wherefore, Moron dwelt in “captivity all the remain- der of his days; and he begat Cori- antor.
19 And it came to pass that Coriantor dwelt in captivity all his
ays.
36 And in the days of Coriantor there also came many prophets, and prophesied of great and marvelous things, and cried repentance unto the people, and except they should repent the Lord God would execute “judgment against them to their utter destruction;
21 And that the Lord God would send or bring forth “another people to possess the *land, by his power, after the manner by which he brought their fathers.
22 And they did reject all the words of the prophets, because of their secret society and wicked abominations.
23 And it came to pass that Cori- antor begat “Ether, and he died, having dwelt in captivity all his
days. CHAPTER 12

3 For he did ’cry from the *morn- ing, even until the going down of the sun, exhorting the people to believe in God unto repentance lest they should be ‘destroyed, saying unto them that ‘by ‘faith all things are fulfilled—
4 Wherefore, whoso believeth. in God might with “surety "hope for a better world, yea, even a place at the right hand of God, which ‘hope cometh of “faith, maketh an ‘anchor to the souls of men, which would make them sure and _ steadfast, always abounding in ‘good works, being led to ’glorify God.
5 And it came to pass that Ether did prophesy great and marvelous things unto the people, which they did not believe, because they “saw them not.
6 And now, I, Moroni, would speak somewhat concerning these things; I would show unto the world that “faith is things which are "hoped for and ‘not seen; wherefore, dispute not because ye see not, for ye receive no 4witness until after the *trial of your faith.
7 For it was by faith that Christ showed himself unto our fathers, after he had risen from the dead; and he showed not himself unto them until after they had faith in him; wherefore, it must needs: be

that some had _ faith in him, for he showed himself ‘not. unto the world.
8 But because of the faith of men he has shown himself unto the world, and glorified the name of the Father, and prepared a way that thereby others might be partakers of the -heavenly gift, that they might hope for those things which they have not seen.
9 Wherefore, ye may also have hope, and be partakers of the gift, if ye will but have faith.
10 Behold it was by faith that they of old were “called after the holy order of God.
11 Wherefore, by faith was the law of Moses given. But in the “gift of his Son hath God prepared a more "excellent way; and it is by faith that it hath been fulfilled.
12 For if there be no “faith among the children of men God can do no *’miracle among them; wherefore, he showed not himself until after their faith.

wrought “miracles wrought them by ‘faith, even those who were before Christ and also those who were after.
17 And it was by faith that the three disciples obtained a promise that they should %not taste of death; and they obtained not the promise until after their faith.
18 And neither at any time hath any wrought miracles until after their faith; wherefore they first believed in the Son of God.
19 And there were many whose faith was so exceedingly strong, even “before Christ came, who could not be kept from within the °veil, but truly saw with their eyes the things which they had beheld with an eye of faith, and they were glad.
20 And behold, we have seen in this record that one of these was the brother of Jared; for so great was his faith in God, that when God put forth his “finger he could not hide it from the sight of the brother of Jared, because of his word which he had spoken unto him, which word he had obtained by faith.
21 And after the brother of Jared had beheld the finger of the Lord, because of the “promise which the brother of Jared had obtained by faith, the Lord could not withhold anything from his sight; wherefore he showed him all things, for he could no longer be kept without the veil.
22 And it is by faith that my fathers have obtained the “promise that these things should come unto their brethren through the Gentiles ; therefore the Lord hath commanded me, yea, even Jesus Christ.

23 And I said unto him: Lord, the Gentiles will “mock at these things, because of our weakness in writing ; for Lord thou hast made us ‘mighty in word by faith, but thou hast not made us mighty in writing; for thou hast made all this people that they could speak much, because of the Holy Ghost which thou hast given them;
24 And thou hast made us that we could write but little, because of the ?awkwardness of our hands. Behold, thou hast not made us mighty in ‘writing like unto the brother of Jared, for thou madest him that the things which he ‘wrote were mighty even as thou art, unto the over- powering of man to read them.
25 Thou hast also made our words powerful and great, even that we “cannot write them ; wherefore,when we write we behold our °weakness, and stumble because of the placing of our words; and I fear lest the Gentiles shall ‘mock at our words.
26 And when I had said this, the Lord spake unto me, saying: *Fools ’mock, but they shall mourn; and my grace is sufficient for the meek, that they shall take no advantage of your weakness;
27 And if men come unto me I will show unto them their *weakness. I >give unto men weakness that they may be humble; and my ‘grace is sufficient for all men that “humble themselves before me; for if they humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make ‘weak things become strong unto them.

28 Behold, I will show unto the Gentiles their weakness,and I will show unto them that “faith, hope and charity bringeth unto me—the fountain of all "righteousness.
29 And I, Moroni, having heard these words, was *comforted, and said: O Lord, thy righteous will-be done, for I know that thou workest unto the children of men according to their faith;
30 For the brother of Jared: said unto the mountain Zerin, ?Re- move—and it was removed. And if he had not had faith it would not have moved; wherefore thou work- est after men have faith.
31 For thus didst thou manifest thyself unto thy disciples; for “after they had °faith, and did speak in thy name, thou didst show thyself unto them in great power.
32 And I also remember that thou hast said that thou hast prepared a house for man, yea, even among the ¢mansions of thy Father, in which man might have a more excellent “hope; wherefore man must: hope, or he cannot receive-an inheritance in the place which thou hast prepared.
33 And again, I remember that thou hast said that thou hast “loved the world, even unto the laying down of thy life for the world, that thou mightest take it again to pre- pare a place for the children of men.
34 And now I know that. this “love which thou hast had for the children of men is charity; where- fore, except men shall have charity they cannot inherit that. place
ETHER 12:28-41
which thou hast prepared in the mansions of thy Father.
35 Wherefore, I know by this thing which thou hast said, that if the Gentiles have not “charity, because of our weakness, that thou wilt prove them, and °take away their ‘talent, yea, even that which they have received, and give unto them who shall have more abundantly.
36 And it came to pass that I prayed unto the Lord that he would give unto the Gentiles “grace, that they might have charity.
37 And it came to pass that the Lord said unto me: If they have not charity it mattereth not unto thee, thou hast been faithful; wherefore, thy garments shall be made “clean. And because thou hast seen thy *’weakness thou shalt be made strong, even unto the sitting down in the place which I have prepared in the mansions of my Father.
38 And now I, Moroni, bid fare- well unto the Gentiles, yea, and also unto my brethren whom I love, until we shall meet before the *judgment-seat of Christ, where all men shall know that my °garments are not spotted with your blood.
39 And then shall ye know that I have “seen Jesus, and that he hath talked with me °face to face, and that he told me in ‘plain humility, even as a man telleth another in mine own language, concerning these things;

CHAPTER 13
Ether speaks of a New Jerusalem to be built in America by the seed of Joseph—He prophesies, is cast out, writes the Jaredite history, and fore- tells the destruction of the Jaredites— War rages over all the land.
AND ‘now I, Moroni, proceed to finish my record concerning the destruction of the people of whom Ihave been writing.
2 For behold, they rejected all the words of Ether; for he truly told them of all things, from the begin- ning of man; and that after the waters had “receded from off the face of this "land it became a choice land above all other lands, a chosen land of the Lord; wherefore the Lord would have that all men should ‘serve him who dwell upon the face thereof;
3 And that it was the place of the "New Jerusalem, which should *’come down out of heaven, and the holy sanctuary of the Lord.
4 Behold, Ether saw the days of Christ, and he spake concerning a *New Jerusalem upon this land.
5 And he spake also concerning the house of Israel, and the *Jerusalem from whence °Lehi should come— after it should be destroyed it should be built up again, a “holy city unto the Lord; wherefore, it could not be a new Jerusalem for it had

been in a time of old; but it should be built up again, and become a holy city of the Lord; and it should be built unto the house of Israel—
6 And that a *New Jerusalem should be built up upon this land, unto the remnant of the seed of >Joseph, for which things there has been a ‘type.
7 For as Joseph brought his father down into the land of “Egypt, even so he died there; wherefore, the Lord brought a remnant of the seed of Joseph out of the land of Jeru- salem, that he might be merciful unto the seed of Joseph that they should "perish not, even as he was merciful unto the father of Joseph that he should perish not.
8 Wherefore, the remnant of the house of Joseph shall be built upon this “land; and it shall be a land of their inheritance; and they shall build up a holy city unto the Lord, like unto the Jerusalem of old; and they shall ‘no more be confounded, until the end come when the earth shall pass away.
9 And there shall be a “new heaven and a new earth; and they shall be like unto the old save the old have passed away, and all things have become new.
10 And then cometh the New Jerusalem; and blessed are they who dwell therein, for it is they whose garments are “white through the blood of the Lamb; and they are they who are numbered among the remnant of the seed of Joseph, who were of the house of Israel.
11 And then also cometh the *Jerusalem of old; and the inhabi- tants thereof, blessed are they, for

they have been washed.in-the blood of the Lamb; and they are they who were scattered and gathered in from the four quarters of the earth, and from the ’north countries, and are partakers of the fulfilling of the covenant which God made with their father, “Abraham.
12 And when these things come, bringeth to pass the scripture which saith, there are they who were “first, who shall be last; and there are they who were last, who shall be first.
13 And I was about to write more, but I am forbidden; but great and marvelous were the prophecies of Ether; but they esteemed him as naught, and cast him out; and he *hid himself in the cavity of a rock by day, and by night he went forth viewing the things which should come upon the people.
14 And as he dwelt in the cavity of a rock he made the “remainder of this record, viewing the destruc- tions which came upon the people, by night.
15 And it came to pass that in that same year in which he was cast out from among the people there began to be a great war among the people, for there were many who rose up, who were mighty men, and sought to destroy Coriantumr by their secret plans of wickedness, of which hath been spoken.
16 And now Coriantumr, having studied, himself, in all the arts of war and all the cunning of the world, wherefore he gave battle unto them who sought to destroy him.
17 But he repented not, neither his “fair sons nor daughters; neither the fair sons and daughters of Cohor; neither the fair sons and daughters of Corihor; and in fine, there were none of the fair sons and daughters
ETHER 13:12-25
upon the face of the whole earth who repented of their sins.
18 Wherefore, it came to pass that in the first year that Ether dwelt in the cavity of a rock, there were many people who were slain by the sword of those “secret combina- tions, fighting against Coriantumr that they might obtain the kingdom.
19 And it came to pass that the sons of Coriantumr fought much and bled much.
20 And in the second year the word of the Lord came to Ether, that he should go and “prophesy unto *Coriantumr that, if he would re- pent, and all his household, the Lord would give unto him his king- dom and spare the people—
21 Otherwise they should be de- stroyed, and all his household save it were himself. And he should only live to see the fulfilling of the prophecies which had been spoken concerning “another people receiv- ing the land for their inheritance; and Coriantumr should: receive a burial by them; and every soul should be destroyed save it were °Coriantumr.
22 And it came to pass that Coriantumr repented not, neither his household, neither the people; and the wars ceased not; and they sought to °kill Ether, but he fled from before them and hid again in the cavity of the rock.
23 And it came to pass that there arose up Shared, and he also gave battle unto Coriantumr; and he did beat him, insomuch that in the third year he did bring him into captivity.
24 And the sons of Coriantumr, in the fourth year, did beat Shared, and did obtain the kingdom again unto their father.
25 Now there began to be a war

upon all the face of the land, “every man with his band fighting for that which he desired.
26 And there were robbers, and in fine, all manner of wickedness upon all the face of the land.
27 And it came to pass that Corian- tumr was exceedingly angry with Shared, and he went against him with his armies to battle; and they did meet in great anger, and they did meet in the valley of Gilgal; and the battle became exceedingly sore.
28 And it came to pass that Shared fought against him for the space of three days. And it came to pass that Coriantumr beat him, and did pur- sue him until he came to the plains of Heshlon.
29 And it came to pass that Shared gave him battle again upon the plains; and behold, he did beat Coriantumr, and drove him back again to the valley of Gilgal.
30 And Coriantumr gave Shared battle again in the valley of Gilgal, in which he beat Shared and slew him.
31 And Shared wounded Corian- tumr in his thigh, that he did not go to battle again for the space of two years, in which time all the people upon the face of the land were shedding blood, and there was none torestrain them.
CHAPTER 14
The iniquity of the people brings a curse upon the land—Coriantumr engages in warfare against Gilead, then Lib, and then Shiz—Blood and carnage cover the land.
AND now there began to be a great “curse upon all the land because of the iniquity of the people, in which, if a man should lay his tool or his sword upon his shelf, or upon the place whither he would keep it, behold, upon the morrow, he could not find it, so great was the curse upon the land.
2 Wherefore every man did cleave

unto that which was his own, with his hands, and would not borrow neither would he lend; and every man kept the hilt of his sword in his right hand, in the ?defence of his property and his own life and of his wives and children.
3 And now, after the space of two years, and after the death of Shared, behold, there arose the brother of Shared and he gave battle unto Coriantumr, in which Coriantumr did beat him and did pursue him to the wilderness of Akish.
4 And it came to pass that. the brother of Shared did give battle unto him in the wilderness of Akish; and the battle became exceedingly sore, and many thousands fell _by the sword.
5 And it came to pass that Corian- tumr did lay siege to the wilderness; and the brother of Shared did march forth out of the wilderness by night, and slew a part of the army of Coriantumr, as they were drunken.
6 And he came forth to the land of “Moron, and placed himself upon the throne of Coriantumr.
7 And it came to pass that Corian- tumr dwelt with his army in the wilderness for the space of two years, in which he did receive great strength to his army.
8 Now the brother of Shared, whose Name was Gilead, also received great strength to his army, because of secret combinations.
9 And it came to pass that his high priest murdered him as he sat upon his throne.
10 And it came to pass that one of the secret combinations murdered him in a secret pass, and obtained unto himself the kingdom; and his name was Lib; and Lib was a man of great stature, more than any other man among all the people.
11. And it came to pass that in the first year of Lib, Coriantumr came up unto the land of Moron, and gave battle unto Lib.

12 And it came to,pass that he fought with Lib, in which Lib did smite upon his arm that he was wounded; nevertheless, the army of Coriantumr did press forward upon Lib, that he fled to the borders upon the seashore.
13. And it came to pass that Coriantumr pursued him; and Lib gave battle unto him upon the seashore.
14 And it came to pass that Lib did smite the army of Coriantumr, that they fled again to the wilder- ness of Akish.
15 And it came to pass that Lib did pursue him until he came to the plains of Agosh. And Coriantumr had taken all the people with him as he fled before Lib in that quarter of the land whither he fled.
16 And when he had come to the plains of Agosh he gave battle unto Lib, and he smote upon him until he died; nevertheless, the brother of Lib did come against Corian- tumr in the stead thereof, and the battle became exceedingly sore, in the which Coriantumr fled again be- fore the army of the brother of Lib.
17 Now the name of the brother of Lib was called Shiz. And-it came.to pass that Shiz pursued after Corian- tumr, and he did overthrow many cities, and he did slay both women and children, and he did burn the cities.
18 And there went a fear of Shiz throughout all the land; yea, a cry went forth throughout the land— Who can stand before the army of Shiz? Behold, he sweepeth the earth before him!
19 And it came to pass that the people began to flock together in armies, throughout all the face of the land.
20 And they were divided; and a part of them fled to the army of Shiz, and a part of them fled to the army of Coriantumr.
21 And so great and lasting had

been the war, and so long had been the scene of bloodshed and carnage, that the whole face of the land was covered with the “bodies of the °dead.
22 And so swift and speedy was the war that there was none left to bury the dead, but they did march forth from the shedding of “blood to the shedding of blood, leaving the bodies of both men, women, and children strewed upon the face of the land, to become a prey to the ‘worms of the flesh.
23 And the “scent thereof went forth upon the face of the land, even upon all the face of the land; where- fore the people became troubled by day and by night, because of the scent thereof.
24 Nevertheless, Shiz did “not cease to pursue Coriantumr; for he had sworn to avenge himself upon Coriantumr of the blood of his brother, who had been slain, and the word of the Lord which came to Ether that Coriantumr should not fall by the sword.
25 And thus we see that the Lord did visit them in the fulness of his “wrath, and their wickedness and abominations had prepared a way for their everlasting destruction.
26 And it came to pass that Shiz did pursue Coriantumr ‘eastward, even to the borders by the seashore, and there he gave battle unto Shiz forthe space of three days.
27 And so terrible was the de- struction among the armies of Shiz that the people began to be fright- ened, and began to flee before the armies of Coriantumr; and they fled to the land of Corihor, and swept off the inhabitants before them, all them that would not join them.
28 And they pitched their tents in the valley of Corihor; and Corian- tumr pitched his tents in the valley of Shurr. Now the valley of Shurr was near the hill Comnor; where-

fore, Coriantumr ‘did gather his armies together upon the hill Com- nor, and did sound a trumpet unto the armies of Shiz to invite them forth to battle.
29 And it came to pass that they came forth, but were driven again; and they came the second time, and they were driven again the second time. And it came to pass that they came again the third time, and the battle became exceedingly sore.
30 And it came to pass that Shiz smote upon Coriantumr that he gave him many deep wounds; and Coriantumr, having lost his blood, fainted, and was carried away as though he were dead.
31 Now the loss of men, women and children on both sides was so great that Shiz commanded his people that they should not pursue the armies of Coriantumr; where- fore, they returned to their camp.
CHAPTER 15
Millions of the Jaredites are slain in battle—Shiz and Coriantumr assem- ble all the people to mortal combat— The Spirit of the Lord ceases to strive with them—The Jaredite nation is utterly destroyed—Only Corian- tumr remains.
AND it came to pass when Corian- tumr had recovered of his wounds, he began to remember the “words which Ether had spoken unto him.
2 He saw that there had been slain by the sword already nearly “two millions of his people, and he began to sorrow in his heart; yea, there had been slain two millions of mighty men, and also their wives and their children.
3 He began to repent of the evil which he had done; he began to remember the words which had been:spoken by the mouth of all the prophets, and he saw them that they were fulfilled thus far, every whit; and his soul “mourned and refused to be "comforted.

4 And it came to pass that he wrote an epistle unto Shiz, desiring him that he would spare the people, and he would give up the kingdom for the sake of the lives of the people.
5 And it came to pass that when Shiz had received his epistle he wrote an epistle unto Coriantumr, that if he would give himself up, that he might slay him with his own sword, that he would spare the lives of the people.
6 And it came to pass that the people repented not of their in- iquity; and the people of Corian- tumr were stirred up to anger against the people of Shiz; and the people of Shiz were stirred up to anger against the people of Corian- tumr; wherefore, the people of Shiz did give battle unto the people of Coriantumr.
7 And when Coriantumr saw that he was about to fall he fled again before the people of Shiz.
8 And it came to pass that he came to the waters of Ripliancum, which, by interpretation, is large, or to exceed all; wherefore, when they came to these waters they pitched their tents; and Shiz also pitched his tents near unto them ; and there- fore on the morrow they did come to battle.
9 And it came to pass that they fought an exceedingly sore battle, in which Coriantumr was wounded again, and he fainted with the loss of blood.
10 And it came to pass that the armies of Coriantumr did press upon the armies of Shiz that they beat them, that they caused them to flee before them; and they did flee southward, and did pitch their tents in a place which was called Ogath.
11 And it came to pass that the army of Coriantumr did pitch their tents by the hill Ramah; and it was that same hill where my father Mormon did ‘hide up the records unto the Lord, which were sacred.

13 And it came to pass that Ether did “behold all.the doings of the people; and he beheld that the people who were for Coriantumr were gathered together to the army of Coriantumr; and the people who were for Shiz were gathered: to- gether to the army of Shiz.
14 Wherefore, they were for the space of four years gathering to- gether the people, that they might get all who were upon the face of the land, and that they might receive all the strength which it was pos- sible that they could receive.

16 And it came to pass that when it was night they were weary, and retired to their camps; and after they had retired to their camps they took up a howling and a “lamentation for the loss of the slain of their people; and so great were their cries, their howlings and lamentations, that they did rend the air exceedingly.
17 And it came to pass that on the morrow they did go again to battle, and great and terrible was that day; nevertheless, they conquered not, and when the night came again they did rend the air with their cries, and their howlings, and their mournings, for the loss of the slain of their
ple.

19 But behold, the “Spirit of the Lord had ceased striving with them, and Satan had full power over the ‘hearts of the people; for they were given up unto the hardness of their hearts, and the blindness of their minds that they might be destroyed; wherefore they went again to battle.
20 And it came to pass that they fought all that day, and when the night came they slept upon their swords. .
21 And on the morrow they fought even until the night came.
22 And when the night came they were “drunken with anger, even as a man who is drunken with wine; and they slept again upon their swords.

Repentant persons are baptized and
fellowshipped—Church members who
repent are forgiven—Meetings are
ors by the power of the Holy host.
AND now I speak concerning bap- tism. Behold, elders, priests, and teachers were baptized; and they were not baptized save they brought forth “fruit meet that they were worthy of it.
2 Neither did they receive any unto baptism save they came forth with a “broken "heart and a contrite spirit, and witnessed unto the church that they truly repented of all their sins.
3 And none were received unto baptism save they “took upon them the name of Christ, having a deter- mination to serve him to the end.
4 And after they had been received unto baptism, and were wrought upon and “cleansed by the power of the Holy Ghost, they were: num-

bered among the people of the ¢church of Christ; and their ‘names were taken, that they might be remembered and nourished by the good word of God, to keep them in the right way, to keep them con- tinually “watchful unto prayer, ‘relying alone upon the merits of Christ, who was the author and the finisher of their faith.
5 And the “church did meet to- gether "oft, to ‘fast and to pray, and to speak one with another concern- ing the welfare of their souls.
6 And they did “meet together oft to partake of bread and wine, in *’remembrance of the Lord Jesus.
7 And they were strict to observe that there should be “no iniquity among them; and whoso was found to commit iniquity, and ’three wit- nesses of the church did condemn them before the ‘elders, and if they repented not, and ‘confessed not, their names were “blotted out, and they were not ‘numbered among the people of Christ.
8 But “as oft as they repented and sought forgiveness, with real "intent, they were ‘forgiven.
9 And their meetings were ?con- ducted by the church after the manner of the workings of the Spirit, and by the “power of the Holy Ghost; for as the power of the Holy Ghost led them whether to preach, or to exhort, or to pray, or to supplicate, or to sing, even so it was done.

CHAPTER?
An invitation to enter into the rest of the Lord—Pray with real intent— The Spirit of Christ enables men to know good from evil—Satan per- suades men to deny-Christ and do evil—The prophets manifest the com- ing of Christ—By faith miracles are wrought. and angels minister—Men should hope for eternal life and cleave unto charity.
AND now I, Moroni, write a few of the words of my father Mormon, which he spake concerning faith, hope, and charity; for after this manner did he speak unto the people, as he taught them in the synagogue which they had built for the place of worship.
2 And now I, Mormon, speak unto you, my beloved brethren; and it is by the “grace of God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, and his holy will, because of the gift of his ‘calling unto me, that I am per- mitted to speak unto you at this time.
3 Wherefore, I would speak unto you that are of the ¢church, that are the °peaceable followers of Christ, and that have obtained a sufficient ‘hope by which ye can enter into the @rest of the Lord, from this time henceforth until ye shall rest with him in heaven.
4 And now my brethren, I judge these things of you because of your peaceable “walk with the children of men.

5 For I remember the word of God which saith by their works ye shall know them; for if their works be good, then they are good also.
6 For behold, God hath said a man being “evil cannot do that which is good; for if he °offereth a gift, or ‘prayeth unto God, except he shall do it with real ¢intent it profiteth him nothing.
7 For behold, it is not counted unto him for righteousness. _
8 For behold, if a man being Zevil giveth a gift, he doeth it *grudg- ingly; wherefore it is counted unto him the same as if he had retained the gift; wherefore he is counted evil before God.
9 And likewise also is it counted evil unto a man, if he shall pray and not with “real intent of heart; yea, and it profiteth him nothing, for God receiveth nonesuch.
10 Wherefore, a man being evil cannot do that which is good; neither will he give a good gift.
11 For behold, a bitter “fountain cannot bring forth good water; neither can a good fountain bring forth bitter water; wherefore, a man being a servant of the devil cannot follow Christ; and if he ‘follow Christ he cannot be a ‘servant of the devil.
12 Wherefore, all things which are °g00d cometh of God; and that which is "evil cometh of the devil; for the devil is an enemy unto God, and fighteth against him con- tinually, and inviteth and enticeth D&C 19:23. TG Sincerity. lla Prov. 13: 14;

to ‘sin, and to do that which is evil continually.
13 But behold, that which is of God inviteth and enticeth to do “good continually; wherefore, every thing which inviteth and °enticeth to do ‘good, and to love God, and to serve him, is “inspired of God.
14 Wherefore, take heed, my be- loved brethren, that. ye do not judge that which is “evil to be of God, or that which is good and of God to be of the devil.
15 For behold, my brethren, it is given unto you to *judge, that ye may know good from evil; and the way to judge is as plain, that ye may know with a perfect knowledge, Sig daylight is from the dark
nie For behold, the Spirit of Christ is given to every ’man, that he may ‘know good from evil; wherefore, I show unto you the way to judge; for every thing which inviteth to do good, and to persuade to believe in Christ, is sent forth by the power and gift of Christ ; wherefore ye may know with a perfect knowledge it is of God.
17 But whatsoever thing persuad- eth men to do “evil, and believe not in Christ, and deny him, and serve not God, then ye may know with a perfect knowledge it is of the devil; for after this manner doth the devil work, for he persuadeth no man to do good, no, not one; neither do his angels; neither do they who subject themselves unto him.

18 And now, my brethren, seeing | that ye know the “light by which ye | may judge, which light is the light of Christ, see that ye do not judge wrongfully; for with that same >judgment which ye judge ye shall also be judged.
19 Wherefore, I beseech of you, brethren, that ye should search diligently in the “light of Christ that ye may know good from evil; and if ye will lay hold upon every good thing, and condemn it not, ye certainly will be a °child of Christ.
20 And now, my brethren, how is it possible that ye can lay hold upon every good thing?
21 And now I come to that faith, of which I said I would speak; and I will tell you the way whereby ye may lay hold on every good thing.
22 For behold, God “knowing all
things, being from °everlasting to
everlasting, behold, he sent ‘angels to minister unto the children of men, to make manifest concern- ing the coming of Christ; and in Christ there should come every good thing.
23 And God also declared unto prophets, by his own mouth, that Christ should come.
24 And behold, there were divers ways that he did manifest things unto the children of men, which were good; and all things which are good cometh of Christ; otherwise men were “fallen, and there could no good thing come unto them.

25 Wherefore, by the.ministering of “angels, and by every word which proceeded forth out of the mouth of God, men began to exercise faith in Christ; and thus by faith, they did lay hold upon every good thing; and thus it was until the coming. of Christ.
26 And after that he came men also were “saved by faith in his name; and by faith, they become the ’sons of God. And as surely as Christ liveth he spake these words unto our fathers, saying: “Whatsoever thing ye shall ask the Father in my name, which is good, in faith believing that ye shall receive, behold, it shall be done unto you.
27 Wherefore, my beloved breth- ren, have “miracles ceased because Christ hath ascended into heaven, and hath sat down on the right hand of God, to ’claim of the Father his rights of mercy which he hath upon the children of men?
28 For he hath answered the ends of the law, and he claimeth all those who have faith in him; and they who have faith in him will *cleave unto every good thing; wherefore he ’advocateth the cause of the children of men;.and he dwelleth eternally in the heavens.
29 And because he hath done this, my beloved brethren, have miracles ceased? Behold I say unto you, Nay; neither have “angels ceased to minister unto the children of men.
30 For behold, they are subject unto him, to minister according to the word of his command, showing themselves unto them of strong faith

and. a firm mind in every form of *zodliness.
31.And the office of their ministry is to call men unto repentance, and to fulfil and to do the work of the covenants of the Father, which he hath made unto the children of men, to prepare the way among the children: of men, by declaring the word of Christ unto the ¢chosen vessels of the Lord, that they may bear testimony of him.
32 And by so doing, the Lord God prepareth the way that the @residue of men may have "faith in Christ, that tne Holy Ghost may have place in their hearts, according to the power thereof; and after this manner bringeth to pass the Father, the covenants which he hath made unto the children of men.
33 And Christ hath said: ?If ye will have °faith in me ye shall have power to do whatsoever thing is “expedient in me.
34 And he hath said: *Repent all ye ends of the earth, and come unto me, and be baptized in my name, and have faith in me, that ye may be saved.
35 And now, my beloved brethren, if this be the case that these things are true which I have spoken unto you, and God will show unto you, with “power and great glory at the last ’day, that they are true, and if they are true has the day of miracles ceased?
36 Or have angels ceased to appear unto the children of men? Or has he *withheld the power of the Holy Ghost from them? Or will he, so

long as time shall last, or the earth shall stand, or there shall be one man upon the face thereof to be saved?
37 Behold I say unto you, Nay; for it is by faith that *miracles are wrought; and it is by faith that angels appear and minister unto men; wherefore, if these things have ceased wo be unto the children of men, for it is because of unbelief, and allis vain.
38 For no man can be saved, according to the words of Christ, save they shall have faith in his name; wherefore, if these things have ceased, then has faith ceased also; and awful is the state of man, for they are as though there had been no redemption made.
39 But behold, my- beloved breth- ren, I judge better things of you, for I judge that ye have faith in Christ because of your meekness; for if ye have not faith in him then ye are not “fit to be numbered among the people of his church.
40 And again, my beloved breth- ren, I would speak unto you con- cerning “hope. How is it that ye can attain unto faith, save ye shall have hope?
41 And whatisit that ye shall “hope for? Behold I say unto you that ye shall have "hope through the atone- ment of Christ and the power of his resurrection, to be raised unto life ‘eternal, and this because of your faith in him according tothe promise.
42 Wherefore, if a man have “faith he ’must needs have hope; for with- out faith there cannot be any hope.

44 If so, his *faith and hope is vain, for none is "acceptable before God, save the ‘meek and lowly in heart; and if a man be meek and lowly in heart, and ¢confesses by the power of the Holy Ghost that Jesus is the Christ, he must needs have charity; for if he have not charity he is nothing; wherefore he must needs have charity.

Infant baptism is an evil tion—Lutle children are
Christ because of the atonement— Faith, repentance, meekness and lowliness of heart, receiving the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end lead
to salvation.
AN epistle of my “father Mormon, written to me, Moroni; and it was written unto me soon after my call- ing to the ministry. And on this
wise did he write unto
ing:
2 My _ beloved son, Moroni, I rejoice exceedingly that your Lord Jesus Christ hath been mindful of you, and hath called you to his ministry, and to his holy work.
3 1am mindful of you always in my prayers, continually praying unto God the Father in the name of his Holy Child, Jesus, that he, through his infinite “goodness and grace, will keep you through the endurance of faith on his name to the end.
4 And now, my son, I speak unto you concerning that which grieveth me exceedingly; for it grieveth me that there should “disputations rise
among you.
5 For, if-1 have learned the truth, there have been disputations among you concerning the baptism of your
little children.
6 And now, my son, I desire that ye should labor diligently, that this gross error should be removed from

among you; for, for this intent I have written this epistle.
7 For immediately after I had learned these things of you I in- quired of the Lord concerning the matter. And the “word of the Lord came to me by the power of the Holy Ghost, saying:
8 “Listen to the words of Christ, your Redeemer, your Lord and your God. Behold, I came into the world not to call the righteous but sinners to repentance; the ’whole need no physician, but they that are sick; wherefore, little “children are¢whole, for they are not capable of commit- ting ‘sin; wherefore the curse of fAdam is taken from them in me, that it hath no power over them; and the law of circumcision is done away in me.
9 And after this manner did the Holy Ghost manifest the word of God unto me; wherefore, my beloved son, I know that it is solemn “mockery before God, that yé should baptize little children.
10 Behold I say unto you that this thing shall ye teach—repentance and baptism unto those who are *accountable and capable of com- mitting sin; yea, teach parents that they must repent and be baptized, and humble themselves as their little "children, and they shall all be saved with their little children.
11 And their little *children need no repentance, neither baptism. Behold, baptism is unto repentance to the fulfilling the commandments unto the "remission of sins.
12 But little children are alive in Christ, even from the foundation of the world; if not so, God is a partial

God, and also-.a changeable God, and a ’respecter to persons; for how many little children have died without baptism!
13. Wherefore, if little children could not be saved without baptism, these must have gone to an endless hell.
14 Behold I say unto you, that he that supposeth that little children need baptism is in the gall of bitter- ness and in the bonds of iniquity; for he hath neither “faith, hope, nor charity; wherefore, should he be cut off while in the thought, he must go down to hell.
15 For awful is the wickedness to suppose that God saveth one child because of baptism, and the other must perish because he hath no baptism.
16 Wo be unto them that shall pervert the ways of the Lord after this manner, for they shall perish except they repent. Behold, I speak with boldness, having “authority from God; and I fear not what man can do; for *perfect ‘love ¢casteth out all fear.
17 And I am filled with “charity, which is everlasting love; where- fore, all children are alike unto me; wherefore, I love little children with a perfect love; and they are all alike and °partakers of salvation.
18 For I know that God is not a partial God, neither a changeable being; but he is “unchangeable from ball eternity to all eternity.
19 Little *children cannot repent; wherefore, it is awful wickedness to deny the pure mercies of God unto

them, for they are all alive in him because of his mercy.
20 And he that saith that little children need baptism denieth the mercies of Christ, and setteth at naught the “atonement of him and the power of his redemption.
21 Wo unto such, for they. are in danger of death, “hell, and an °end- less torment. I speak it boldly; God hath commanded me. Listen unto them and give heed, or they stand against you at the ‘judgment-seat of Christ.
22 For behold that all little chil- dren are “alive in Christ, and also all they that are without the "law. For the power of ‘redemption cometh on all them that have ¢no law; wherefore, he that is not con- demned, or he that is under no con- demnation, cannot repent; and unto such baptism availeth nothing—
_ 23 But it is mockery before God,
denying the mercies of Christ, and the power of his Holy Spirit, and putting trust in “dead works.
24 Behold, my son, this thing ought not to be; for ‘repentance is unto them that are under: con- demnation and under the curse of a broken law.
25 And the first fruits of “repen- tance is baptism; and baptism cometh by faith unto the fulfilling the commandments; and the ful- filling the commandments bringeth ‘remission of sins;
26 And the remission of sins bringeth “meekness, and lowliness of heart; and because of meekness and lowliness of heart cometh the visita-

28 Pray for them, my son, that repentance may come unto them. But behold, I fear lest the Spirit hath “ceased ’striving with them; and in this part of the land they are also seeking to put down all power and authority which cometh from God; and they are ‘denying the Holy Ghost.
29 And after rejecting so great a knowledge, my son, they must per- ish soon, unto the fulfilling of the prophecies which were spoken by the prophets, as well as the words of our Savior himself.
30 Farewell, my son, until I shall write unto you, or shall meet you again. Amen.
CHAPTER 9
The second epistle of Mormon to his son Moroni.
Both the Nephites and the Lamanites are depraved and degenerate—They torture and murder each other— Mormon prays that grace and good- ness may rest upon Moroni forever.

My beloved son, I write unto you again that ye may know that I am yet alive; but I write somewhat of that which is grievous.
2 For behold, I have had a sore battle with the Lamanites, in which we did not conquer; and Archeantus has fallen by the sword, and also Luram and Emron; yea, and we have lost a great number of our choice men.
3-And now behold, my son, I fear lest the Lamanites shall destroy this people; for they do not repent, and Satan stirreth them up con- tinually to “anger one with another.
4 Behold, I am laboring with them continually; and when I speak the word of God with “sharpness they tremble and anger against me; and when I use no sharpness they °hard- en their hearts against it; wherefore, I fear lest the Spirit of the Lord hath ceased ‘striving with them.
5 For so exceedingly do they anger that it seemeth me that they have no fear of death; and they have lost theiz love, one towards another; and they “thirst after blood and revenge continually.
6 And now, my beloved son, not- withstanding their hardness, let us labor “diligently; for if we should cease to "labor, we should be brought under condemnation; for we have a labor to perform whilst in this tabernacle of clay, that we may con- quer the enemy of all righteousness, and rest our souls in the kingdom of God.
7 And now I write somewhat con- cerning the sufferings of this people.

MORONI 9:8-22
For according to the knowledge which I have received from Amoron, behold, the Lamanites have many prisoners, which they took from the tower of Sherrizah; and there were men, women, and children.
8 And the husbands and fathers of those women and children they have slain; and they feed the women upon the “flesh of their husbands, and the children upon the flesh of their fathers; and no water, save a little, do they give unto them.
9 And notwithstanding this great "abomination of the Lamanites, it doth not exceed that of our people in Moriantum. For behold, many of the daughters of the Lamanites have they taken prisoners; and after "de- priving them of that which wasmost dear and precious above all things, which is ‘chastity and ¢virtue—
10 And after they had done this thing, they did murder them in a most “cruel manner, torturing their bodies even unto death; and after they have done this, they devour their flesh like unto wild beasts, because of the hardness of their hearts; and they do it for a token of bravery.
11 O my beloved son, how can a people like this, that are without civilization—
12 (And only a few years have passed away, and they were a civil and a delightsome people)
13 But O my son, how can a people like this, whose “delight is in so much abomination—
14 How can we expect that God will “stay his hand in judgment against us?
15 Behold, my heart cries: Wo unto this people. Come out in judgment, O God, and hide their sins, and wickedness, and abomina- tions from before thy face !

16 And again, my son, there are many “widows and their daughters who remain in Sherrizah; and that part of the provisions which the Lamanites did not carry away, be- hold, the army of Zenephi has car- ried away, and left them to wander whithersoever they can for food; and many old women do faint by the way and die.
17 And the army which is with me is weak; and the armies of the La- manites are betwixt Sherrizah and me; and as many as have fled to the army of “Aaron have fallen victims to their awful brutality.
18 O the depravity of my people! They are without “order and with- out mercy. Behold, Iam but aman, and I have but the ’strength of a man, and I cannot any longer enforce my commands.
19 And they have become strong
in their perversion; and they are
alike brutal, sparing none, neither old nor young; and they delight in everything save that which is good; and the suffering of our women and our children upon all the face of this land doth exceed everything; yea, tongue cannot tell, neither can it be written.
20-And now, my son, I dwell no longer upon this horrible scene. Behold, thou knowest the wicked- ness of this people; thou knowest that they are without principle, and past feeling; and their wicked- ness doth exceed that of the Lamanites.
21 Behold, my son, I cannot recom- mend them unto God lest he should smite me.
22 But behold, my son, I recom- mend thee unto God, and I trust in Christ that thou wilt be saved; and I “pray unto God that he will spare thy life, to witness the return of his

people unto him, or*heir utter destruction; for I know that they must perish except they ‘repent and return unto him.
23 And if they perish it will be like unto the “Jaredites, because of the wilfulness of their hearts, "seeking for blood and ‘revenge.
24 And if it so be that they perish, we know that many of our breth- ren have “deserted over unto the Lamanites, and many more will also desert over unto them; wherefore, write somewhat a few things, if thou art spared and I shall perish and not see thee; but I trust that I may see thee soon; for I have sacred records that I would °deliver up unto thee.
25 My son, be faithful in Christ; and may not the things which I have written grieve thee, to weigh thee down unto “death;-but may Christ lift thee up, and may his sufferings and death, and the showing his body unto our fathers, and his mercy and ‘long-suffering, and the hope of his glory and of eternal life, rest in your “mind forever.
26 And may the grace of God the Father, whose throne is high in the heavens, and our Lord Jesus Christ, who sitteth on the “right hand of his power, until all things shall become subject unto him, be, and abide with you forever. Amen.

Ghost—The gifts of the Spirit are dispensed to the faithful—Spiritual gifts always accompany  faith— Moroni’s words speak from the dust —Come unto Christ, be perfected in him, and sanctify your souls.
Now I, Moroni, write somewhat as seemeth me good; and I write unto my brethren, the 7Lamanites; and I would that they should know that *more than °four hundred and twenty years have passed away since the sign was given of the coming of Christ.
2 And I “seal up "these records, after I have spoken a few words by way of exhortation unto you.
3 Behold, I would exhort you that when ye shall read these things, if it be wisdom in God that ye should read them, that ye would remember how “merciful the Lord hath been unto the children of men; from the creation of Adam even down until the time that ye shall receive these things, and °ponder it in your ‘hearts.
4 And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would “ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not °true; and if ye shall ask with a “sincere heart, with 2real in- tent, having “faith in Christ, he will fmanifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost.
5 And by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may “know the ’truth of all things.

just and true; wherefore, nothing that is good denieth the Christ, but acknowledgeth that he is.
7 And ye may ?know that he is, by the power of the Holy Ghost; wherefore I would exhort you that ye deny not the power of God; for he worketh by power, "according to the faith of the children of men, the same today and tomorrow, and forever.
8 And again, I exhort you, my brethren, that ye deny not the {9ifts of God, for they are many; and they come from the same God. And there are different ways that these gifts are administered; but it is the same God who worketh all in all; and they are given by the mani- festations of the “Spirit of God unto men, to profit them.
9 *For behold, to one is given by the Spirit of God, that he may *teach the word of wisdom;
10 And to another, that he may "teach the word of ’knowledge by the same Spirit;
11 And to another, exceedingly great “faith; and to another, the gifts of "healing by the same Spirit;
12. And again, to another, that he may work mighty “miracles;
13 And again, to another, that he may prophesy concerning all things;
14 And again, to another, the be- holding of angels and ministering spirits;
15 And again, to another, all kinds of tongues;
16 And again, to another, the interpretation of “languages.and of divers kinds of tongues.
17 And all these gifts come by the
530
Spirit of Christ; and they come unto every man severally, according as he will.
18 And I would exhort you, my beloved brethren, that ye remember that “every good gift cometh of Christ.
19 And I would exhort you, my beloved brethren, that ye remember that he is the “same yesterday, to- day, and forever, and that all these gifts of which I have spoken, which are spiritual, never will be done away, even as long as the world shall stand, only according to the bunbelief of the children of men.
20. Wherefore, there must be “faith; and if there must be faith there must also be hope; and: if there must be hope there must oS be charity.
21 And except ye have “charity ye can in nowise be saved in the king- dom of God; neither can ye be saved in the kingdom of God if ye have not faith; neither can ye if ye have no hope.
22 And if ye have no hope ye must needs be in “despair; and despair cometh because of iniquity.
23 And Christ truly said unto our fathers: “If ye have faith ye can do all things which are expedient unto me.
24 And now I speak unto all the ends of the earth—that if the day cometh that the power and gifts of God shall be done away among you, it shall be “because of unbelief.
25 And wo be unto the children of men if this be the case; for there shall be “none that doeth good among you, no not one. For if there

be one among you that-doeth good, he shall work by the power and gifts of God.
26 And wo unto them who shall do these things away and die, for they “die in their ’sins, and they cannot be saved in the kingdom of God; and I speak it according to the words of Christ; and I lie not.
27 And I exhort you to remember these things; for the time speedily cometh that ye shall know that I lie not, for ye shall see me at the bar of God; and the Lord God will say unto you: Did I not declare my “words unto you, which were writ- ten by this man, like as one °crying from the dead, yea, even as one speaking out of the ‘dust?
28 I declare these things unto the fulfilling of the prophecies. And behold, they shall proceed forth out of the mouth of the everlasting God; and his word shall “hiss forth from generation to generation.
29 And God shall show unto you, that that which I have written is *true.
30 And again I would exhort you that ye would “come unto Christ, and lay hold upon every good °gift, and ‘touch not the evil gift, nor the 4unclean thing.
31 And “awake, and arise from the dust, O Jerusalem; yea, and put on thy beautiful garments, O daughter
MORONI 10:26-34
of Zion; and ‘strengthen thy “stakes and enlarge thy borders for- ever, that thou mayest “no more be confounded, that the covenants of the Eternal Father which he hath made unto thee, O house of Israel, may be fulfilled.
32 Yea, “come unto Christ, and be *nerfected in him, and ‘deny your- selves of all ungodliness; and if ye shall deny yourselves of all ungod- liness, and “love God with all your might, mind and strength, then is his grace sufficient for you, that by his grace ye may be “perfect in Christ; and if by the grace of God ye are perfect in Christ, ye can in nowise deny the power of God.
33 And again, if ye by the grace of God are perfect in Christ, and deny not his power, then are ye “sancti- fied in Christ by the grace of God, through the shedding of the "blood of Christ, which is in the covenant of the Father unto the remission of your ‘sins, that ye become “holy, without spot.
34 And now I bid unto all, fare- well. I soon go to “rest in the *paradise of God, until my ‘spirit and body shall again ¢reunite, and I am brought forth triumphant through the “air, to meet you be- fore the ‘pleasing bar of the great 9Jehovah, the Eternal “Judge of both quick and dead. Amen.
